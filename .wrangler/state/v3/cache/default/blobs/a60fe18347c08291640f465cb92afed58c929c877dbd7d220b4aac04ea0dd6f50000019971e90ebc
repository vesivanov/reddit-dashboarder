I feel like this is something you quickly learn with experience, but I want to get the discussion out there in the open. \n\nThe DRY principle is one of the most misunderstood principles in software engineering. Just because two repetitions or code look the same does not mean they are the same. DRY is more often than not misapplied. DRY is about having a consistent source of truth for business logic more than anything. It’s about centralizing knowledge, not eliminating repetition. Every time you write reusable code, you’re creating a coupling point between parts of the system. You should be careful in doing so.\n\nThere is a real cost to premature abstraction. Say you have two buttons that both use bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded. A DRY purist would immediately extract this into a .btn-primary class or component. But what happens when the designer asks you to make one button slightly larger, or change the color of just one? Now you’re either breaking the abstraction or creating .btn-primary-large variants. You’ve traded simple, explicit code for a brittle abstraction.\n\nThe same thing happens with JavaScript. You see two functions that share a few lines and immediately extract a utility. But when requirements change, you end up with utility functions that take a dozen parameters or do completely different things based on flags. The cure becomes worse than the disease.\n\nCoupling is the real enemy. Every time you create a reusable piece of code, you’re saying “these things will always change together.” But how often is that actually true? When you abstract too early, you’re making a bet that two separate parts of your system will evolve in lockstep. Most of the time, you lose that bet.\nThis coupling makes refactoring a nightmare. Want to change how one part works? First you need to understand how it affects every other part that shares the abstraction. Want to delete a feature? Good luck untangling it from the shared utilities it depends on.\n\nThe obsession with eliminating visual repetition often leads to premature abstraction. Sometimes repetition is actually good. It makes code more explicit, easier to understand, and prevents tight coupling between unrelated parts of your system. \n\nWhen people complain that Tailwind violates DRY, they’re missing the point entirely. CSS classes aren’t business logic. Having flex items-center in multiple places isn’t violating DRY any more than using the same variable name in different functions.\n\nWhen does DRY actually matter? DRY has its place. You absolutely should centralize business logic, validation rules, and data transformations. If your user authentication logic is duplicated across your codebase, that’s a real DRY violation. If your pricing calculation algorithm exists in multiple places, fix that immediately.\n\nThe key is distinguishing between knowledge and coincidence. Two pieces of code that happen to look similar today might evolve completely differently tomorrow. But business rules? Those should have a single source of truth.\n\nThere’s a better approach. Start with repetition. Make it work first, then identify patterns that actually represent shared knowledge. And if you think an abstraction should exist, you can always formalize it later by creating a reusable component, function, or shared service. \n\nYou can always extract an abstraction later, but you can rarely put the toothpaste back in the tube.​​​​​","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was going to add this as a response to a recent Tailwind thread, but it’s something I see come up time and time again: people misunderstanding the DRY principle.

That’s where I’d like to get to eventually, but that’s a “yet another tool” barrier to “getting started” that I’d like to be able to allow developers to do without for as long as I can in the development cycle. I’m shooting to eventually ship the same “driver” code that we run in the browser in a GraphQl server once all is said and done with just another driver (albeit much simpler than all the others) that uses the native GraphQl format.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions for drivers and platforms are welcome, though I can’t promise I will implement them. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"damienwebdev","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nmcg0g/daffodil_build_complex_ecommerce_storefronts_and/","domain":"github.com","score":1,"num_comments":0,"created_utc":1758409880,"thumbnail":"https://external-preview.redd.it/p324w1Zndy_vDFeeoAvpVa4lc7aV_lugvIRohjjEuF8.png?width=140&amp;height=70&amp;crop=140:70,smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00b4d511dc3fbf6744f64579a1abf4e80a81820c"},{"id":"1nmbzn6","subreddit":"webdev","title":"[Show Off Saturday] A Linux Command Cheat Sheet I Designed from Scratch – Feedback please!","selftext":"Hey everyone!

But then how would I generate an api key on my account for every user each time. ? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now OpenAI’s error messages are very clear so like in case of error I could just catch the error and display their message to the user which isn’t an issue but I wanted to ask if there’s some sort of reusable function I could use to plug in all the rate limits and then use them in my calls to their api? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’d love some guidance and any code suggestions would be greatly appreciated… as it’s my first time using OpenAI’s api !   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"mo_ahnaf11","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nkvaoq/how_do_you_guys_handle_rate_limits_on_the_api_in/","domain":"self.webdev","score":0,"num_comments":8,"created_utc":1758260340,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nkpce7","subreddit":"webdev","title":"Rate my portfolio","selftext":"I hope you can rate my portfolio and give me some feedback!\nAlso you can leave a message in the guest book section! \n","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you can rate my portfolio and give me some feedback!\nAlso you can leave a message in the guest book section! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"IDontUseEdge","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nkpce7/rate_my_portfolio/","domain":"pcoder.me","score":17,"num_comments":9,"created_utc":1758242430,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nkmxyk","subreddit":"webdev","title":"Pixel art styled components library","selftext":"Hello guys,\n\nI would like to show you my side-project, a pixel art styled components library built on top of shadcn.\n\nIt uses the [Registry](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry) flow provided by shadcn, so every component can be imported in your project using a shadcn CLI command, no package download required.\n\n[https://www.pixelactui.com/](https://www.pixelactui.com/)\n\n[https://github.com/pixelact-ui/pixelact-ui](https://github.com/pixelact-ui/pixelact-ui)","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello guys,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to show you my side-project, a pixel art styled components library built on top of shadcn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It uses the &lt;a href=\"https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry\"&gt;Registry&lt;/a&gt; flow provided by shadcn, so every component can be imported in your project using a shadcn CLI command, no package download required.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pixelactui.com/\"&gt;https://www.pixelactui.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/pixelact-ui/pixelact-ui\"&gt;https://github.com/pixelact-ui/pixelact-ui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"alburt22","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nkmxyk/pixel_art_styled_components_library/","domain":"self.webdev","score":7,"num_comments":2,"created_utc":1758235859,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nkmcsb","subreddit":"webdev","title":"How to handle status trackers?","selftext":"[Example we have \\(Ignore spanish, what matters is the idea of the status tracker\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xobhn4blzzpf1.png?width=1246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1a347ff2e03eff58db345535428ea28754e7f24)\n\nHi, just for some quick context, i'm working in an application where clients can request some products to some vendors related to financial services.

After shipping dozens of production apps with both, here's my unfiltered take.\n\n**TL;DR: v0 for anything serious, Bolt for prototypes, hackathon demos and initial scoping layouts**\n\n## The Data\n\n- v0: $42M ARR, part of Vercel's ecosystem (valued at $3.25B)\n- Bolt: $40M ARR, impressive but...\n\n## Why I Choose v0 99% of the Time\n\n**1. Code Quality**\n\nWith v0 we get React components that are *actually* production-ready (provided the right prompting is given to v0 Agent). Proper TypeScript types, accessibility attributes, error boundaries - typically these things come together very naturally when pair programming in v0 environment. Every component follows modern patterns and integrates cleanly.\n\nBolt? Yes it generates... Stuff... Full-stack apps and such. But the overall Agentic coder is lacking in the model IQ space, by about 20 points to v0's Agent.\n\n**2. Deployment Infrastructure**\n\nThis is where it's not even close:\n\n- Vercel deployment = instant global edge network (Industry Standard)\n- 99.99% uptime \n- Automatic rollbacks, preview deployments, analytics\n- Supabase, Fal, Blob, Upstash, Neon, xAi, + more = Everything is ready for you from the get go\n- Same infrastructure as Netflix, TikTok, Uber (and I do not know of any big or medium companies that are running on Bolt, except for Bolt itself maybe)\n\nMy experience with Bolt's deployments and overall code gen? It's ok...\n\n**3. The Developer Experience Reality**\n\nv0 focuses on what it does best: UI components and FIRE FRONTENDS. It doesn't try to be everything. When I need a complex dashboard component, v0 delivers clean, maintainable code in minutes.\n\nBolt kind of tries to do everything - frontend, backend, database. And long story short... It is jack of all trades, master of none. The backend code it generates? Let's just say there's a reason 67% of their users aren't developers.\n\n## Real Production Example\n\nBuilt an event platform last week (AI Summit 2025):\n\n- v0: Generated all UI components with single prompts\n- Integrated with existing Next.js codebase seamlessly\n- Deployed to Vercel in seconds =&gt; ready for continued repository maintenance with Claude Code in Cursor, etc\n\n## The Bolt Reality\n\nLook, Bolt has its place. If you're a PM who needs a quick prototype, or you're at a hackathon, go for it. The fact that they went from near-bankruptcy to $40M ARR is genuinely impressive.\n\nBut when enterprise clients are paying top dollar for platforms, apps and their legacy to AI-native stack rollovers? When you're responsible for code that needs to scale? When security audits and performance matter?\n\nThat's when Bolt's limitations become deal-breakers.\n\n## My Workflow\n\n1. Design with Claude Code (Yes, try that 🙂)\n2. Generate components and initial codebase with v0 \n3. Integrate into Next.js with Claude Code and WARP Agent in VS Code/Cursor\n4. Deploy to Vercel\n5. Ship to production\n\n## Hot Take\n\nThe fact that Bolt markets to non-developers tells you everything. It's Wix for the AI age - impressive for beginners, limiting for professionals.\n\nv0 is a professional tool for professional developers. Period.\n\nAnyone else notice how all the Bolt success stories are MVPs and demos, while v0 powers actual production apps? That's not coincidence.\n\n**Edit:** Currently working on new material which will showcase my workflow. And yes, v0's integration with Vercel's infrastructure is a massive competitive advantage that Bolt can't match.\n\nFor those asking about specific use cases:\n\n- Landing pages: v0\n- Component libraries: v0\n- Design systems: v0\n- Quick MVPs: Either works\n- Production apps: v0 + custom backend\n- Enterprise deployments: Only v0/Vercel\n\n---\n\n*Note: Not affiliated with either company, just a dev who ships code for a living.*","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey folks, seeing lots of confusion about v0 and Bolt lately.

You can ask if there&amp;#39;s anything you need to know &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you~!!!💕💕 :D&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"Frosty_Tune_4686","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nklxzk/crossplatform_apps_what_technologies_should_i/","domain":"self.webdev","score":1,"num_comments":1,"created_utc":1758233298,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nklr5f","subreddit":"webdev","title":"I built a blog website.","selftext":"","selftext_html":"","author":"egecreates","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nklr5f/i_built_a_blog_website/","domain":"i.redd.it","score":48,"num_comments":15,"created_utc":1758232832,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/siKrX0P5j1wBSdvBIstFp1X2h7yAVDYG1RfbOH2Ng6I.jpg"},{"id":"1nkkvc4","subreddit":"webdev","title":"dumpall — Stop fighting node_modules, dump clean project context in one go","selftext":"Web projects always end up with tons of noise (hello node\\_modules 👋).  \n\n\\`dumpall\\` is a simple CLI that lets you scoop up only the code you care about into one clean Markdown doc.\n\n\n\nGreat for:\n\n\\- Sharing code with teammates\n\n\\- Preparing AI prompts/debugging sessions\n\n\\- Archiving project snapshots\n\n\\- Cleaning up context for reviews\n\n\n\nQuick use:\n\n`npx dumpall . -e node_modules -e .git --clip`\n\n\n\nRepo 👉 [https://github.com/ThisIsntMyId/dumpall](https://github.com/ThisIsntMyId/dumpall)  \n\nDocs/demo 👉 [https://dumpall.pages.dev/](https://dumpall.pages.dev/)\n\n","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web projects always end up with tons of noise (hello node_modules 👋).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;`dumpall` is a simple CLI that lets you scoop up only the code you care about into one clean Markdown doc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Great for:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Sharing code with teammates&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Preparing AI prompts/debugging sessions&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Archiving project snapshots&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Cleaning up context for reviews&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quick use:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx dumpall . -e node_modules -e .git --clip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Repo 👉 &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/ThisIsntMyId/dumpall\"&gt;https://github.com/ThisIsntMyId/dumpall&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Docs/demo 👉 &lt;a href=\"https://dumpall.pages.dev/\"&gt;https://dumpall.pages.dev/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"ThisIsntMyId","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nkkvc4/dumpall_stop_fighting_node_modules_dump_clean/","domain":"self.webdev","score":0,"num_comments":5,"created_utc":1758230719,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nkklt5","subreddit":"webdev","title":"30 years of Ozone","selftext":"Dr. Ozone was a huge inspiration for me in the 90s.

To make things easier, I tried building an app with Builder.ai. The UI came out fine (confirmed by teammates), but the database connection wasn’t working.\n\nSo I switched to building it with React + Supabase. The database connection worked, but the React app itself doesn’t render in the browser.

As apps grow, we start fighting with cascading re-renders from context providers, and we spend a lot of time manually optimizing with `useMemo`, selectors, and memoized components. It often feels like we're fighting our tools to prevent them from doing unnecessary work.\n\nThis led me to explore a different approach centered on two main principles:\n\n**1. Move State into a Web Worker:** Instead of having state logic compete with the UI on the main thread, what if the entire state model lived and executed in a separate thread? The UI thread's only job would be to apply minimal, batched updates it receives from the worker. In theory, this should make it architecturally impossible for your state logic to ever cause UI jank.\n\n**2. Truly Automatic Dependency Tracking:** The other piece of the puzzle is making reactivity effortless. Instead of manually defining dependency arrays, the system can use Proxies to observe which properties are accessed during a render. By trapping these `get` operations, the framework can build a perfect dependency graph automatically. When a property changes, it knows *exactly* which components or formulas to update.\n\nI wrote a detailed article that goes into the weeds of how these two concepts can be combined.
