We have noticed a downward trend in terms of revenues for the last 2 years, not so dramatic but still relevant to take consideration and do something about it fast.\n\nI've been noticed about how our website is hosted: right now, we pay 80€ per month (yes, not typo, I was shocked too when I heard about it) for hosting/domain and \"personalized support\". But this is complete legal scam because the website's design is horrendous like it was made in 2010 era. To give context, it's a showcase site with only 4 pages. No way we keep paying 80€/month again.\n\nWith that said, we decided to redesign the entire thing from scratch through HTML. For domain, we'll probably migrate to Hostinger and for hosting, GitHub Pages seems to be a good option.\n\nI've heard about how website redesign could affect SEO, how bad things could go? Will our PageRank drop significantly with the domain/host transfer &amp; redesign? I've used tools like PageSpeed Insights and my redesign has a better score, but I wanted to hear your opinions/tips about it. I am aware this is probably the worst-case scenario when it comes to SEO.\n\nThe good news is that we have good reviews on Google Maps (4,5/5 stars for ~300 reviews) and the PageRank seems to be good.\n\nTechnical info:\nThe live website = almost static website (use of .php, only for animated images): home page, 3 pages, and form page. We have on average 2000 views per month.
