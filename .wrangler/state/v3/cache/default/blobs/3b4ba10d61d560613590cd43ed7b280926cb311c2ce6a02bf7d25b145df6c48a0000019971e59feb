Ive built/building an operations assistant tool for cafe&amp;#39;s. I&amp;#39;ve got some key areas that i&amp;#39;m focusing on, however i want to narrow it down to 4 or 5 key areas. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far i&amp;#39;m trying to solve the issues of: wastage and stock alerts, rota&amp;#39;s, marketing prompts (ideas), training tasks, and more. I&amp;#39;d still like to find out what area you&amp;#39;d like to automate in your business, and if you were to step back for 4 weeks, what would break down first?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"Cangingperceptions","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1nlsrs3/i_need_help_for_coffee_shop_owners_but_open_to_all/","domain":"self.business","score":5,"num_comments":7,"created_utc":1758356972,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nls5ti","subreddit":"business","title":"uhhh so my new site just made $1600 in 10 days??","selftext":"kinda freaking out tbh… built https://companionguide.ai like 10 days ago, posted about it on Reddit every day and somehow it already pulled in $1600.\n\nno clue what i’m doing half the time lol. slapped on some ads, threw together package deals, added a couple affiliate partners… and now it’s actually making money??\n\nthis was supposed to be a small side project, now i’m sitting here wondering if i need to treat it like a “real” thing… or quit my job?","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;kinda freaking out tbh… built &lt;a href=\"https://companionguide.ai\"&gt;https://companionguide.ai&lt;/a&gt; like 10 days ago, posted about it on Reddit every day and somehow it already pulled in $1600.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;no clue what i’m doing half the time lol. slapped on some ads, threw together package deals, added a couple affiliate partners… and now it’s actually making money??&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;this was supposed to be a small side project, now i’m sitting here wondering if i need to treat it like a “real” thing… or quit my job?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"Resident-Wall8171","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1nls5ti/uhhh_so_my_new_site_just_made_1600_in_10_days/","domain":"self.business","score":0,"num_comments":9,"created_utc":1758354618,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nlq7hm","subreddit":"business","title":"Reshaping Deal Pipelines: A Look at JPMorgan's Strategic Team Developments","selftext":"As the global market recovers, deal pipelines are becoming increasingly opportunistic.
