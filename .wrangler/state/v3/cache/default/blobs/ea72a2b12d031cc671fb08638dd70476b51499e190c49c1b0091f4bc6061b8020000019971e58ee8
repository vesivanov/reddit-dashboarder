I feel like this is something you quickly learn with experience, but I want to get the discussion out there in the open. \n\nThe DRY principle is one of the most misunderstood principles in software engineering. Just because two repetitions or code look the same does not mean they are the same. DRY is more often than not misapplied. DRY is about having a consistent source of truth for business logic more than anything. It’s about centralizing knowledge, not eliminating repetition. Every time you write reusable code, you’re creating a coupling point between parts of the system. You should be careful in doing so.\n\nThere is a real cost to premature abstraction. Say you have two buttons that both use bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded. A DRY purist would immediately extract this into a .btn-primary class or component. But what happens when the designer asks you to make one button slightly larger, or change the color of just one? Now you’re either breaking the abstraction or creating .btn-primary-large variants. You’ve traded simple, explicit code for a brittle abstraction.\n\nThe same thing happens with JavaScript. You see two functions that share a few lines and immediately extract a utility. But when requirements change, you end up with utility functions that take a dozen parameters or do completely different things based on flags. The cure becomes worse than the disease.\n\nCoupling is the real enemy. Every time you create a reusable piece of code, you’re saying “these things will always change together.” But how often is that actually true? When you abstract too early, you’re making a bet that two separate parts of your system will evolve in lockstep. Most of the time, you lose that bet.\nThis coupling makes refactoring a nightmare. Want to change how one part works? First you need to understand how it affects every other part that shares the abstraction. Want to delete a feature? Good luck untangling it from the shared utilities it depends on.\n\nThe obsession with eliminating visual repetition often leads to premature abstraction. Sometimes repetition is actually good. It makes code more explicit, easier to understand, and prevents tight coupling between unrelated parts of your system. \n\nWhen people complain that Tailwind violates DRY, they’re missing the point entirely. CSS classes aren’t business logic. Having flex items-center in multiple places isn’t violating DRY any more than using the same variable name in different functions.\n\nWhen does DRY actually matter? DRY has its place. You absolutely should centralize business logic, validation rules, and data transformations. If your user authentication logic is duplicated across your codebase, that’s a real DRY violation. If your pricing calculation algorithm exists in multiple places, fix that immediately.\n\nThe key is distinguishing between knowledge and coincidence. Two pieces of code that happen to look similar today might evolve completely differently tomorrow. But business rules? Those should have a single source of truth.\n\nThere’s a better approach. Start with repetition. Make it work first, then identify patterns that actually represent shared knowledge. And if you think an abstraction should exist, you can always formalize it later by creating a reusable component, function, or shared service. \n\nYou can always extract an abstraction later, but you can rarely put the toothpaste back in the tube.​​​​​","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was going to add this as a response to a recent Tailwind thread, but it’s something I see come up time and time again: people misunderstanding the DRY principle.

All too often, I’m forced to set up docker-compose, Kubernetes, pay for a SaaS, wait for IT at the merchant to get me access, or run a VM somewhere just to build some UI for an ecommerce platform that a company uses. More often than not, I just want to start up a little local http server and start writing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I currently have support for Magento/MageOS/Adobe Commerce, I have partial support for Shopify and I recently wrote a product driver for Medusa - &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/graycoreio/daffodil/pull/3939\"&gt;https://github.com/graycoreio/daffodil/pull/3939&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you’re thinking “this isn’t performant, can’t you just do all of this with GraphQl on the server”, you’re exactly correct! That’s where I’d like to get to eventually, but that’s a “yet another tool” barrier to “getting started” that I’d like to be able to allow developers to do without for as long as I can in the development cycle. I’m shooting to eventually ship the same “driver” code that we run in the browser in a GraphQl server once all is said and done with just another driver (albeit much simpler than all the others) that uses the native GraphQl format.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions for drivers and platforms are welcome, though I can’t promise I will implement them. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"damienwebdev","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nmcg0g/daffodil_build_complex_ecommerce_storefronts_and/","domain":"github.com","score":1,"num_comments":0,"created_utc":1758409880,"thumbnail":"https://external-preview.redd.it/p324w1Zndy_vDFeeoAvpVa4lc7aV_lugvIRohjjEuF8.png?width=140&amp;height=70&amp;crop=140:70,smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00b4d511dc3fbf6744f64579a1abf4e80a81820c"},{"id":"1nmbzn6","subreddit":"webdev","title":"[Show Off Saturday] A Linux Command Cheat Sheet I Designed from Scratch – Feedback please!","selftext":"Hey everyone!
