They offered to do a one-time review of my site to provide recommended enhancements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One guy recommended I should by doing more PR-like activity to get backlinks from reputable local websites, not buying them through PBNs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Another agency suggested they&amp;#39;d focus on specific pages on the site (e.g. spend 4 months on a single landing page), go for a lower volume of high quality backlinks (e.g. 1 link every 4 months for each page they manage), and spend most of their effort on on-site optimisations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;And then, there&amp;#39;s my current agency who spend the whole budget on backlinks, and ladder the backlinks by increasing DR over time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m on a lean budget - say $1.5k-$2k AUD per month (1k-1.3k USD). This seems to be the entry point for many agencies over here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given every agency comes with a radically different approach, it&amp;#39;s difficult to know what my routine SEO work should actually involve? Should it be a healthy balance of on-site and backlink building? Should I be purely focussing on on-site with my low budget? Should I stay away from PBNs?
