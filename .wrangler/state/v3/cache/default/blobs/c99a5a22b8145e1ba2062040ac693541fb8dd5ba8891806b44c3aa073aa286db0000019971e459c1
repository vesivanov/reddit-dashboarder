No course, no coaching, no agency pitch. **I don't want your money**.\n\nI'm just a guy building Marz (a fully-automated creator platform) who's sick of watching startups torch cash on ads and manual influencer outreach. This is the exact workflow we're using right now to spin up hundreds of creator posts in days and beat paid ads on CAC—steal it.\n\nAll I ask: **try it, then come back and drop your tweaks/results in the comments.**\n\n# The 3-step playbook 👇\n\n**Step 1. Feed the machine the right inputs.**\n\nTraditional approach = scrape CreatorLookup, cold-email 20K leads, pray.\nMarz flips that:\n\n1. Pick your product, geo, and budget inside the dashboard (takes ~3 min).\n2. Our engine auto-pulls **10K–15K qualified micro-creators** (&lt;150 K followers, &gt;5 K avg views, niche match) from IG/TikTok/YouTube.\n3. Dynamic outreach goes out under your brand domain—sequences are auto-personalized (name + niche) and drive creators to a self-serve join link.\n\n👉 Result: we consistently see **45–55 % open, 20 % reply, 8–12 % onboard** with zero human chase. Your only \"manual\" work is approving the creative brief if you want to (optional).\n\n**Step 2. Let programmatic deals do the negotiating for you.**\n\nOld way = back-and-forth DMs, PDF contracts, Net-30.\nNew way:\n\n1. Creator hits the join link → autofills social handles, contact, payout method.\n2. Marz fires back a dynamic CPM offer (usually $1.80–$2.50) based on their historic RPM.\n3. Contract + escrow payment auto-generate via Stripe Connect; creator can see exactly how much they'll earn **per 1 K views**.\n4. AI spits out a brief + 3 hook options; creator records → uploads.\n5. Optional draft approval (brands that skip this go live 24 h faster and see better creative).\n\nEnd of month, Marz pulls first-party analytics straight from the platform APIs, releases payouts, and reconciles your budget—no chasing screenshots.\n\n👉 Net result: **&lt;60 seconds of brand labor per creator**, scalable to 500+ creators without adding headcount.\n\n**Step 3. The numbers that matter.**\n\nLast 30-day sprint (B2C subscription app):\n\n* 412 approved creators, 387 went live within 5 days.\n* 14.7 M tracked views, 126 K clicks to App Store.\n* **eCAC $18.40** vs. $50.10 on Meta Ads (-63 %).\n* **$1.92 blended CPM** after Marz fees (there are none) + creator payouts.\n* 9 creators smashed 1 M views each; we cap payouts at 3 M so extra impressions were free → effective campaign CPM dropped to **$1.31**.\n\nWe paused the bottom 70 % performers in Marz with one click, kept the top 30 %, and re-filled the pipeline with 300 fresh creators—compounding reach each cycle.\n\n# Why it works\n\n1. **Volume beats \"perfect.\"** Programmatic sourcing means you never run out of talent.\n2. **Aligned incentives.** CPM pricing rewards heavy hitters and quietly weeds out the rest.\n3. **Speed = learning.** Five-day feedback loops let you iterate offers/creatives faster than paid ads stuck in review.\n4. **Trust via escrow.** Creators get instant payouts; brands never pre-pay for content that doesn't ship.\n\n# Steal this today\n\nYou don't need 400 creators out of the gate. Spin up a $2 K test budget, target 50 micro-creators, and watch what happens. Cut the dead weight, double down on the winners, repeat.\n\nInfluencer marketing doesn't have to be spreadsheets and prayers. Turn it into code, let the machine run, and go build product instead.\n\n— Tomas\n\nP.S. If you try any twist on this—different niches, CPL instead of CPM, seed-stage budgets—**drop the data below**.

Feed the machine the right inputs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Traditional approach = scrape CreatorLookup, cold-email 20K leads, pray.\nMarz flips that:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pick your product, geo, and budget inside the dashboard (takes ~3 min).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our engine auto-pulls &lt;strong&gt;10K–15K qualified micro-creators&lt;/strong&gt; (&amp;lt;150 K followers, &amp;gt;5 K avg views, niche match) from IG/TikTok/YouTube.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dynamic outreach goes out under your brand domain—sequences are auto-personalized (name + niche) and drive creators to a self-serve join link.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;👉 Result: we consistently see &lt;strong&gt;45–55 % open, 20 % reply, 8–12 % onboard&lt;/strong&gt; with zero human chase. Your only &amp;quot;manual&amp;quot; work is approving the creative brief if you want to (optional).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2. Let programmatic deals do the negotiating for you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Old way = back-and-forth DMs, PDF contracts, Net-30.\nNew way:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Creator hits the join link → autofills social handles, contact, payout method.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Marz fires back a dynamic CPM offer (usually $1.80–$2.50) based on their historic RPM.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contract + escrow payment auto-generate via Stripe Connect; creator can see exactly how much they&amp;#39;ll earn &lt;strong&gt;per 1 K views&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;AI spits out a brief + 3 hook options; creator records → uploads.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Optional draft approval (brands that skip this go live 24 h faster and see better creative).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;End of month, Marz pulls first-party analytics straight from the platform APIs, releases payouts, and reconciles your budget—no chasing screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;👉 Net result: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;60 seconds of brand labor per creator&lt;/strong&gt;, scalable to 500+ creators without adding headcount.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3. The numbers that matter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last 30-day sprint (B2C subscription app):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;412 approved creators, 387 went live within 5 days.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;14.7 M tracked views, 126 K clicks to App Store.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eCAC $18.40&lt;/strong&gt; vs. $50.10 on Meta Ads (-63 %).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$1.92 blended CPM&lt;/strong&gt; after Marz fees (there are none) + creator payouts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;9 creators smashed 1 M views each; we cap payouts at 3 M so extra impressions were free → effective campaign CPM dropped to &lt;strong&gt;$1.31&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We paused the bottom 70 % performers in Marz with one click, kept the top 30 %, and re-filled the pipeline with 300 fresh creators—compounding reach each cycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Why it works&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volume beats &amp;quot;perfect.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Programmatic sourcing means you never run out of talent.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aligned incentives.&lt;/strong&gt; CPM pricing rewards heavy hitters and quietly weeds out the rest.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed = learning.&lt;/strong&gt; Five-day feedback loops let you iterate offers/creatives faster than paid ads stuck in review.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust via escrow.&lt;/strong&gt; Creators get instant payouts; brands never pre-pay for content that doesn&amp;#39;t ship.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Steal this today&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t need 400 creators out of the gate. Spin up a $2 K test budget, target 50 micro-creators, and watch what happens. Cut the dead weight, double down on the winners, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Influencer marketing doesn&amp;#39;t have to be spreadsheets and prayers. Turn it into code, let the machine run, and go build product instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;— Tomas&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S.

Not because candidates aren't qualified, but because they make the same 5 critical tailoring mistakes over and over.\n\nThe 7-Second Reality Check Studies show recruiters spend an average of 7.4 seconds on initial resume review. Eye-tracking research reveals they look at: Name (1 sec) → Current title (2 sec) → Current company (1.5 sec) → Previous positions (2 sec) → Education (0.9 sec). If you haven't hooked them by then, you're out. Mistake #1: The \"Spray and Pray\" Approach\n\nUsing the same generic resume for every application is career suicide. ATS systems can detect generic resumes instantly, and they're programmed to rank them lower. Your beautifully designed, one-size-fits-all resume? It's probably scoring 20-30% match rate.\n\nReal Example: Marketing Manager Application\n\n❌ Generic Version (30% match):\n\n\"Experienced marketing professional with 5+ years driving brand growth and managing campaigns.\" ✅ Tailored Version (78% match):\n\n\"B2B SaaS Marketing Manager with 5+ years driving product-led growth, specializing in HubSpot automation and Account-Based Marketing (ABM) strategies.\" The tailored version mirrors the exact language from the job posting: \"B2B SaaS,\" \"product-led growth,\" \"HubSpot,\" and \"ABM.\" The Manual Fix:\n\nCreate 3-5 base versions targeting different role types. Here's the framework:\n\n• Version 1: Industry-Specific (e.g., \"SaaS Marketing Manager\") • Version 2: Company-Size Specific (e.g., \"Startup Marketing Manager\") • Version 3: Skill-Specific (e.g., \"Digital Marketing Analytics Manager\") • Version 4: Level-Specific (e.g., \"Senior Marketing Manager\") • Version 5: Function-Specific (e.g., \"Product Marketing Manager\") Then spend 10 minutes customizing from these bases rather than starting from scratch. 🚀 Smart Resume Optimization:\n\nMistake #2: Keyword Stuffing Without Context\n\nYes, keywords matter.

Not because candidates aren&amp;#39;t qualified, but because they make the same 5 critical tailoring mistakes over and over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 7-Second Reality Check Studies show recruiters spend an average of 7.4 seconds on initial resume review. Eye-tracking research reveals they look at: Name (1 sec) → Current title (2 sec) → Current company (1.5 sec) → Previous positions (2 sec) → Education (0.9 sec).

Process breakdown below.\n\nWhen done correctly, this can increase activation rate, retention, conversion rate AND reduce churn - improving all KPIs that boost your SaaS valuation.\n\n**The system (4 steps):**\n\n**1. Track everything with a CDP.** Connect all your SaaS user data sources to track every action. Some that I like: RudderStack, PostHog, Segment, amplitude (has some CDP-like features). CDPs allow you to create a unified customer view where you learn your users key drop off points - crucial for product led growth.\n\n**2. Connect to email platform.** Link to your chosen email marketing platform - my favorite email marketing platforms for SAAS are; Loops so, Customer io &amp; Encharge. Segment users based on actions and current stage. Audience segments are constantly updated via API.\n\n**3. Deploy these 9 core flows.** Value-focused multi-step flows to guide users to the next stage. Not spam - only triggered by what they have/haven't done.\n\n* **Welcome** \\- Coach to first \"Aha!\" moment (Trigger: Account created)\n* **Onboarding** \\- Feature education tied to use-case (Trigger: Key milestone/action completed)\n* **No-Login** \\- Re-engage silent users (Trigger: No login for n days)\n* **Gamification/Progress** \\- Celebrate wins, create momentum (Trigger: Task completion)\n* **Feature Limitation** \\- Highlight premium features (Trigger: Gated feature attempt/ tokens limit reached/near)\n* **Referral** \\- Turn users into advocates (Trigger: Activation milestone)\n* **Cancellation** \\- Rescue at-risk accounts (Trigger: Viewed cancellation page x times)\n* **Abandoned Payment** \\- Recover failed checkouts (Trigger: Checkout started &amp; not completed)\n* **Payment Declined** \\- Prevent involuntary churn (Trigger: Charge failed)\n\nThere will be more flows that are unique to your app though these 9 apply to the majority of SaaS. Other examples of flows you might want to implement to drive product led growth are; testimonial/review request flow, user feedback/survey flow and feature request flows.\n\n**4. A/B test and optimize.** Test messaging at every stage. Route data to dashboards showing which emails drive upgrades and how key SaaS growth metrics improve.\n\n**Example - Simple math to show potential impact:**  \nLet's say you have 100 trial signups → 40% activate → 15% of those convert = 6 paying customers\n\nIf your automated flows boost activation by 20 points: 100 signups → 60% activate → 15% convert = 9 customers (50% increase)\n\nAt scale:  \n1,000 signups: 60 vs 90 paid users  \n10,000 signups: 600 vs 900 paid users\n\n*Note: I'm using 15% activation-to-paid conversion which is conservative - many SaaS see higher rates with proper flows. the purpose of this example is to show the value of increasing activation rates using this system*\n\nAs your product scales, this lever will provide more significant results. This example doesn't touch on other crucial benefits such as; churn reduction, improved feature adoption, higher retention, and increased engagement throughout the customer lifecycle.\n\n**When this works best:** When you have reached product-market fit and have a consistent user acquisition channel where small improvements will begin to compound fast at scale.\n\nI've compiled 500+ real email examples from successful SaaS companies across these flow types (as well as other flow/campaign types) - might be helpful when planning your own flows/emails. let me know if you would like it.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR;&lt;/strong&gt; The answer is automated lifecycle email and in-app messages triggered when users take certain actions within your app to guide them to the next stage of the user journey.

Route data to dashboards showing which emails drive upgrades and how key SaaS growth metrics improve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example - Simple math to show potential impact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nLet&amp;#39;s say you have 100 trial signups → 40% activate → 15% of those convert = 6 paying customers&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your automated flows boost activation by 20 points: 100 signups → 60% activate → 15% convert = 9 customers (50% increase)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At scale:&lt;br/&gt;\n1,000 signups: 60 vs 90 paid users&lt;br/&gt;\n10,000 signups: 600 vs 900 paid users&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I&amp;#39;m using 15% activation-to-paid conversion which is conservative - many SaaS see higher rates with proper flows. the purpose of this example is to show the value of increasing activation rates using this system&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As your product scales, this lever will provide more significant results. This example doesn&amp;#39;t touch on other crucial benefits such as; churn reduction, improved feature adoption, higher retention, and increased engagement throughout the customer lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When this works best:&lt;/strong&gt; When you have reached product-market fit and have a consistent user acquisition channel where small improvements will begin to compound fast at scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve compiled 500+ real email examples from successful SaaS companies across these flow types (as well as other flow/campaign types) - might be helpful when planning your own flows/emails. let me know if you would like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"StrikingAngle882","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nmztvt/how_to_increase_saas_trial_conversions_improve/","domain":"self.SaaS","score":7,"num_comments":6,"created_utc":1758479856,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nmzr2c","subreddit":"SaaS","title":"Saas idea","selftext":"Kids spend hours scrolling TikTok and Instagram, but almost none of that time actually builds their brains.

You'd input a quick app/SaaS description, and it'd handle the heavy lifting:\n\n* **Market Research Automation**: Dives into competitors (like similar apps on stores, their ratings and reviews), checks search trends (using stuff like Google Trends or Ahrefs APIs), and pulls user signals from social media, Reddit threads, forums, and industry sites. It'd highlight opportunities and warn about red flags, like if the space is totally oversaturated.\n* **Technical Roadmap Generation**: Breaks features into a prioritized list, recommends tech stacks (e.g., React Native for cross-platform mobile, Firebase for easy backend), and gives rough timelines (like 4-6 weeks for an MVP).\n* **Idea Scoring System**: Gives it a 1-10 score on market potential, competition level, and tech feasibility – all backed by actual data, not just vibes.\n* **Project Management Features**: Lets you tweak plans, add notes to features, track progress, and maybe sync with tools like Trello or Notion.\n\nBut hey, this is just my rough vision – it could be something totally different.
