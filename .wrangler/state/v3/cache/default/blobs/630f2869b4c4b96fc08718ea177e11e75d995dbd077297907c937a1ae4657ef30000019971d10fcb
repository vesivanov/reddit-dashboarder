There’s also a historical baseline so a model that suddenly “feels different” shows up as an actual deviation instead of vibes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s open source and free i’m not selling anything and there are no ads. I honestly built it to sanity-check my own workflow, but it ended up getting way more traffic in the first week than i expected, which tells me a lot of devs are running into the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to kick the tires or critique the methodology, I’d love feedback.

Connect to email platform.** Link to your chosen email marketing platform - my favorite email marketing platforms for SAAS are; Loops so, Customer io &amp; Encharge. Segment users based on actions and current stage. Audience segments are constantly updated via API.\n\n**3.

Seriously, my Twitter feed was full of people showing off their fancy workflows while I was still using almost no automation.  \nTherefore I started to learn &amp; automate small tasks.\n\n**My First Attempts Were Messy**\n\nI was using coding tools like [V0 ](https://v0.app/)and [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code). They're cool for building stuff, but they didn't solve my daily grunt work. I was still drowning in emails, forgetting meetings, and spending hours on boring tasks.\n\nThen I tried [n8n](https://n8n.io/) . Everyone said it was amazing. And yeah, if you know how to code, you can figure it out. But man, it felt like building a rocket ship just to make toast. Every simple thing needed multiple steps, connections, and constant tweaking when something broke.\n\nI spent more time fixing my automations than actually working.\n\n# What Actually Worked\n\nThat's when I discovered prompt-based tools. Instead of connecting boxes and writing code, I could just tell the AI what I wanted in normal English.\n\nI started using [BhindiAI ](https://bhindi.io/)for my daily stuff:\n\n* Sorting through emails and writing replies\n* Setting up meetings without the back-and-forth\n* Updating my project tasks automatically\n* Following up with people who went quiet\n\nFor my side projects, Clay AI became a game-changer. It finds potential customers for me and gives me their info plus what to talk to them about. No more spending weekends researching leads.\n\n# Other Tools That Actually Help\n\nHere's what I use now for different things:\n\n**For repetitive computer stuff:** I use [Zapier ](https://zapier.com/)for simple connections (way easier than n8n) and Shortcuts on Mac for things like file organizing and quick calculations.\n\n**For content:** I have ChatGPT write first drafts of emails, social posts, and even help brainstorm project ideas. Notion AI helps me clean up my messy notes.\n\n**For scheduling:** Calendly handles meeting bookings, and I use Reclaim.ai to automatically block time for focused work.\n\n**For research:** Perplexity is like having a research assistant. I ask it to find information about competitors, market trends, or technical solutions.\n\n**For social media:** Buffer schedules my posts across platforms, and I use Canva's AI to create quick graphics without spending hours in Photoshop.\n\n**What People Get Wrong**\n\nMost people try to automate everything at once. That's backwards.\n\nStart small. Pick one annoying thing you do every day and automate just that. For me, it was email replies. Once that worked, I moved to the next thing.\n\nAlso, don't automate broken processes. If something is messy when you do it manually, automation will just make it messier faster.\n\nAnd honestly? Sometimes the \"automation\" is just using a better tool. I switched from complex project management apps to simple ones that actually work for how my brain operates.\n\n# The Real Change\n\nI'm not saying I never do manual work now. But the difference is huge. I used to start each day with a list of boring tasks. Now I start thinking about what I actually want to build.\n\nMy brain isn't constantly interrupted by \"oh, I need to email that person back\" or \"did I update that spreadsheet?\" Those things just happen in the background.\n\nThe best part? Most of these tools are either free or cost less than a coffee subscription.

No course, no coaching, no agency pitch. **I don't want your money**.\n\nI'm just a guy building Marz (a fully-automated creator platform) who's sick of watching startups torch cash on ads and manual influencer outreach. This is the exact workflow we're using right now to spin up hundreds of creator posts in days and beat paid ads on CAC—steal it.\n\nAll I ask: **try it, then come back and drop your tweaks/results in the comments.**\n\n# The 3-step playbook 👇\n\n**Step 1. Feed the machine the right inputs.**\n\nTraditional approach = scrape CreatorLookup, cold-email 20K leads, pray.\nMarz flips that:\n\n1. Pick your product, geo, and budget inside the dashboard (takes ~3 min).\n2. Our engine auto-pulls **10K–15K qualified micro-creators** (&lt;150 K followers, &gt;5 K avg views, niche match) from IG/TikTok/YouTube.\n3. Dynamic outreach goes out under your brand domain—sequences are auto-personalized (name + niche) and drive creators to a self-serve join link.\n\n👉 Result: we consistently see **45–55 % open, 20 % reply, 8–12 % onboard** with zero human chase. Your only \"manual\" work is approving the creative brief if you want to (optional).\n\n**Step 2. Let programmatic deals do the negotiating for you.**\n\nOld way = back-and-forth DMs, PDF contracts, Net-30.\nNew way:\n\n1. Creator hits the join link → autofills social handles, contact, payout method.\n2. Marz fires back a dynamic CPM offer (usually $1.80–$2.50) based on their historic RPM.\n3. Contract + escrow payment auto-generate via Stripe Connect; creator can see exactly how much they'll earn **per 1 K views**.\n4. AI spits out a brief + 3 hook options; creator records → uploads.\n5. Optional draft approval (brands that skip this go live 24 h faster and see better creative).\n\nEnd of month, Marz pulls first-party analytics straight from the platform APIs, releases payouts, and reconciles your budget—no chasing screenshots.\n\n👉 Net result: **&lt;60 seconds of brand labor per creator**, scalable to 500+ creators without adding headcount.\n\n**Step 3. The numbers that matter.**\n\nLast 30-day sprint (B2C subscription app):\n\n* 412 approved creators, 387 went live within 5 days.\n* 14.7 M tracked views, 126 K clicks to App Store.\n* **eCAC $18.40** vs. $50.10 on Meta Ads (-63 %).\n* **$1.92 blended CPM** after Marz fees (there are none) + creator payouts.\n* 9 creators smashed 1 M views each; we cap payouts at 3 M so extra impressions were free → effective campaign CPM dropped to **$1.31**.\n\nWe paused the bottom 70 % performers in Marz with one click, kept the top 30 %, and re-filled the pipeline with 300 fresh creators—compounding reach each cycle.\n\n# Why it works\n\n1. **Volume beats \"perfect.\"** Programmatic sourcing means you never run out of talent.\n2. **Aligned incentives.** CPM pricing rewards heavy hitters and quietly weeds out the rest.\n3. **Speed = learning.** Five-day feedback loops let you iterate offers/creatives faster than paid ads stuck in review.\n4. **Trust via escrow.** Creators get instant payouts; brands never pre-pay for content that doesn't ship.\n\n# Steal this today\n\nYou don't need 400 creators out of the gate. Spin up a $2 K test budget, target 50 micro-creators, and watch what happens. Cut the dead weight, double down on the winners, repeat.\n\nInfluencer marketing doesn't have to be spreadsheets and prayers. Turn it into code, let the machine run, and go build product instead.\n\n— Tomas\n\nP.S. If you try any twist on this—different niches, CPL instead of CPM, seed-stage budgets—**drop the data below**.

Spin up a $2 K test budget, target 50 micro-creators, and watch what happens. Cut the dead weight, double down on the winners, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Influencer marketing doesn&amp;#39;t have to be spreadsheets and prayers.

My job involves taking brilliant innovations and figuring out how to turn them into actual profitable businesses. After years of seeing what works (and what doesn't), I decided to package these insights to help other entrepreneurs.\n\n**What I've Created:**\n\n**📖 The Startup Blueprint Book**  \nI wrote \"The Startup Blueprint: 14 Steps to Building Your Dream Business\" It's a systematic guide that takes you from idea validation all the way to building your team. No fluff, just practical steps I've seen work time and again. It's on Amazon.\n\n**📱 Ideagauge App**  \nI also built an Android app called Ideagauge that lets you validate business ideas using industry-proven criteria. You can compare different ideas, add your own evaluation criteria, and even get AI analysis of your concept. Only Android for now, ios is coming!\n\n**Here's the thing** \\- I genuinely want to help fellow entrepreneurs succeed. So if you're interested in the book but can't afford it right now, **send me a DM and I'll hook you up with a free PDF copy**. The only thing I ask is that you leave an honest Amazon review afterward (good or bad - I want genuine feedback!).\n\nI'd love to hear from other entrepreneurs about your biggest challenges or get feedback on the app if you try it out.

After years of seeing what works (and what doesn&amp;#39;t), I decided to package these insights to help other entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I&amp;#39;ve Created:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 The Startup Blueprint Book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nI wrote &amp;quot;The Startup Blueprint: 14 Steps to Building Your Dream Business&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s a systematic guide that takes you from idea validation all the way to building your team. No fluff, just practical steps I&amp;#39;ve seen work time and again. It&amp;#39;s on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📱 Ideagauge App&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nI also built an Android app called Ideagauge that lets you validate business ideas using industry-proven criteria. You can compare different ideas, add your own evaluation criteria, and even get AI analysis of your concept. Only Android for now, ios is coming!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the thing&lt;/strong&gt; - I genuinely want to help fellow entrepreneurs succeed. So if you&amp;#39;re interested in the book but can&amp;#39;t afford it right now, &lt;strong&gt;send me a DM and I&amp;#39;ll hook you up with a free PDF copy&lt;/strong&gt;. The only thing I ask is that you leave an honest Amazon review afterward (good or bad - I want genuine feedback!).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to hear from other entrepreneurs about your biggest challenges or get feedback on the app if you try it out. Building something useful for the startup community has become a real passion project for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"lumka1","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nnfu4j/my_startup_book_and_app_to_validate_your_business/","domain":"self.Entrepreneur","score":1,"num_comments":1,"created_utc":1758525377,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnci62","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","title":"Looking for a growth partner for an iOS app","selftext":"I'm looking for a growth partner and help spearhead marketing for an iOS app in the GLP-1 space (ozempic, zepbound, etc).\n\nI've built the app and did some initial organic marketing (faceless TikTok slideshows) that drove the following results in the span of 28 days from launch:\n\n* Downloads: 123\n* Total revenue: $140 (mostly annual subscriptions)\n* Active trials (yet to convert to subscriptions): 7\n* Average spend per customer: $20.4 (post apple fees)\n* Conversion rate: 7.9%\n* TikTok Audience: US (1141 total likes and target demographic is females in the US/Europe b/w the ages of 25-65)\n\nNow, I'm looking to scale the marketing effort to create multiple faceless TikTok accounts, drive reddit marketing, and explore other growth hacks to scale the app. Competitor apps are doing \\~$50k-400k/mo and launched in the last year so the market is nascent and there's plenty of room to grow.\n\nP.S. not looking for an agency or to hire a marketer but rather a growth partner (rev split and potential cofounder) that's driven and has a knack for UGC, content marketing, and creative marketing.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking for a growth partner and help spearhead marketing for an iOS app in the GLP-1 space (ozempic, zepbound, etc).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve built the app and did some initial organic marketing (faceless TikTok slideshows) that drove the following results in the span of 28 days from launch:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Downloads: 123&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Total revenue: $140 (mostly annual subscriptions)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Active trials (yet to convert to subscriptions): 7&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Average spend per customer: $20.4 (post apple fees)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Conversion rate: 7.9%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;TikTok Audience: US (1141 total likes and target demographic is females in the US/Europe b/w the ages of 25-65)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m looking to scale the marketing effort to create multiple faceless TikTok accounts, drive reddit marketing, and explore other growth hacks to scale the app. Competitor apps are doing ~$50k-400k/mo and launched in the last year so the market is nascent and there&amp;#39;s plenty of room to grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. not looking for an agency or to hire a marketer but rather a growth partner (rev split and potential cofounder) that&amp;#39;s driven and has a knack for UGC, content marketing, and creative marketing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"0xdino","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nnci62/looking_for_a_growth_partner_for_an_ios_app/","domain":"self.Entrepreneur","score":1,"num_comments":12,"created_utc":1758513533,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nn54fo","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","title":"Do you have this problem?","selftext":"It all started when I had a problem with my Bose headphones.

I started with a few important core design ideas for this app to make it helpful in real life. These were:\n\n* The quest will be generated using AI and you can personalize it as well.\n* The design will be inspired by Solo Leveling to give the same vibes.\n* A few original SYSTEM concepts like time limits will be removed because everyone cannot have that much free time to follow that like the original anime. (This can be changed if you guys want me to change this in a future update.)\n* The app design will be more like a game rather than a gym tracker app.\n* Along with Gym, I added Art as well (Gym and Art being two most popular daily hobbies for everyone). There's also a MISC section if you want to add any other quest not fitting in Gym or Art.\n\n# So I started making this in a Game Engine. I wanted to make an app to show to my users (which I did today) and actively update it based on the users' feedback (which I will be doing from now on).\n\n# How It Works?\n\nIn this System, you can generate random quests which you have to complete to gain skill points and XP. I will be adding more achievements, leader-board, and quest sharing features in the next version as well. I plan to make it more game-like where you have to complete quests in real life.\n\nEvery quest you are assigned will be completed when you add your picture of completing that quest (you can also opt not to add the picture by just closing the camera to use the default image). This method of completing quests motivates you to complete them, and when you look back at those pictures, they will be showing your level-up journey as well.\n\nThe plan is to target a niche community of the popular anime Solo Leveling but the app I believe can replace your habit-tracker or self-improvement apps.

(This can be changed if you guys want me to change this in a future update.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The app design will be more like a game rather than a gym tracker app.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Along with Gym, I added Art as well (Gym and Art being two most popular daily hobbies for everyone). There&amp;#39;s also a MISC section if you want to add any other quest not fitting in Gym or Art.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;So I started making this in a Game Engine. I wanted to make an app to show to my users (which I did today) and actively update it based on the users&amp;#39; feedback (which I will be doing from now on).&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How It Works?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this System, you can generate random quests which you have to complete to gain skill points and XP. I will be adding more achievements, leader-board, and quest sharing features in the next version as well. I plan to make it more game-like where you have to complete quests in real life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every quest you are assigned will be completed when you add your picture of completing that quest (you can also opt not to add the picture by just closing the camera to use the default image). This method of completing quests motivates you to complete them, and when you look back at those pictures, they will be showing your level-up journey as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The plan is to target a niche community of the popular anime Solo Leveling but the app I believe can replace your habit-tracker or self-improvement apps. What do you guys think about it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"Normal_Finance4358","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nnkjtu/i_am_a_game_dev_and_i_made_a_selfimprovement_app/","domain":"self.Entrepreneur","score":0,"num_comments":3,"created_utc":1758542523,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnhopw","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","title":"How should I do the survey to know about people's problem?","selftext":"I am 17F trynna start SaaS.

That’s where an AI audit or consultation comes in. Just think of this like a business health check before making a big investment,And here’s why it’s worth doing first: Not all tasks should be automated; some processes, like high-touch sales, are better handled by people, while others, like qualifying leads, scheduling, or FAQ handling, are perfect for AI. Without a proper review, you risk wasting money automating the wrong things. An audit helps  you get a clear ROI roadmap, showing where AI will save hours per week, which tasks will cut costs, and how long it’ll take to see ROI, turning AI hype into real business outcomes. Finally, it reduces mistakes, integrating AI without a plan often leads to missed leads from bad workflows, customer frustration from chatbots that don’t answer properly, or compliance/security risks from handling sensitive data wrong; an audit prevents these headaches. the bottom line is that  an AI audit/consultation helps small business owners figure out where AI makes sense and where it doesn’t.

If you serve customers locally, this is probably more important than trying to rank nationally.\n\nLocal SEO works differently than regular SEO. Instead of competing with every business worldwide, you're mainly competing with other businesses in your city or region. Google prioritizes location when showing search results for local services.\n\nYour Google Business Profile is the most important piece. This is the listing that shows up in Google Maps and local search results. It displays your address, hours, phone number, photos, and customer reviews. Keeping this information accurate and updated directly affects your local search visibility.\n\nCustomer reviews play a major role in local rankings. Businesses with more positive reviews typically rank higher than those with fewer reviews. Responding to reviews, both positive and negative, also signals to Google that you're actively managing your online presence.\n\nYour website needs location-specific information to rank locally. Include your city and service area in your page content naturally. Create separate pages for different locations if you serve multiple areas. Don't stuff keywords unnaturally, but make sure your location is clear.\n\nConsistency across online directories matters. Your business name, address, and phone number should match exactly across Google, Yelp, Facebook, industry directories, and your website. Inconsistent information confuses search engines and can hurt your rankings.\n\nLocal keywords work differently than broad keywords. People search for \"plumber near me\" or \"pizza downtown\" rather than just \"plumber\" or \"pizza.\" Include location-based terms in your website content and page titles where relevant.\n\nBuilding local citations helps establish credibility. Citations are mentions of your business name, address, and phone number on other websites like directories, local business associations, or community websites. Quality matters more than quantity.\n\nMobile optimization is crucial for local SEO since most local searches happen on phones. Your website must load quickly and work well on mobile devices. Google uses mobile performance as a ranking factor.\n\nLocal SEO takes time to show results. Changes to your Google Business Profile might appear within days, but improvements to website rankings typically take weeks or months. Consistency and patience are important for long-term success.\n\nAnyone seeing good results from local SEO efforts, or struggling with specific aspects of local search optimization?","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local SEO helps your business show up when people in your area search for what you offer.

Secondly, a paid feature in the Partner network of our main CMS platform delivers consistent leads. In addition, we do a lot of repeat business with existing customers.\n\nOutside of that, I haven't found too much that is predicable, where I can trace a dollar spent to a result.\n\n1) Organic search: Vexingly, we have been #1 on google (organic) for our most-relevant keyword for a few years now. But in my opinion, SERP are polluted by PPC Ads and Map results. Achieving top 5 SERP position just doesnt' seem to mean what it used to.\n\n2) PPC: I dabble in Google Ads, but tend to turn it off after a few months of minimal results.\n\n3) Email Marketing/Automation: in 2023 I started a 1 year effort with Zoominfo. I was really encouraged by this. Within our first few months, we landed an $80k project from an email campaign. After that, we had lots of high-quality leads that led to sales meetings, making the short-list, although not landing additional sales. After those first successful months, Zoominfo literally became devoid of results. Hundreds of emails would go out a week - zero responses. I like Zoominfo a lot.

Secondly, a paid feature in the Partner network of our main CMS platform delivers consistent leads. In addition, we do a lot of repeat business with existing customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside of that, I haven&amp;#39;t found too much that is predicable, where I can trace a dollar spent to a result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Organic search: Vexingly, we have been #1 on google (organic) for our most-relevant keyword for a few years now.

I was really encouraged by this. Within our first few months, we landed an $80k project from an email campaign. After that, we had lots of high-quality leads that led to sales meetings, making the short-list, although not landing additional sales. After those first successful months, Zoominfo literally became devoid of results. Hundreds of emails would go out a week - zero responses. I like Zoominfo a lot.

As a Japanese learner and a coder, I've always wanted there to be an open-source, 100% free for learning Japanese, similar to Monkeytype in the typing community.\n\nUnfortunately, pretty much all language learning apps are closed-sourced and paid these days, and the ones that are free have unfortunately been abandoned.\n\nBut of course, just creating yet another language learning app was not enough - there has to be a unique selling point. So I thought: why not make it crazy and do what no other language learning app ever did and add a gazillion different color themes and fonts, to really hit it home and honor the app's original inspiration, Monkeytype?\n\nAnd so I did. Now, I'm looking to find contributors and testers for the early stages of the app (though we already have a couple thousand monthly users, and they seem to be loving the idea so far!)\n\nBut, I need your help.

As a Japanese learner and a coder, I&amp;#39;ve always wanted there to be an open-source, 100% free for learning Japanese, similar to Monkeytype in the typing community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, pretty much all language learning apps are closed-sourced and paid these days, and the ones that are free have unfortunately been abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But of course, just creating yet another language learning app was not enough - there has to be a unique selling point. So I thought: why not make it crazy and do what no other language learning app ever did and add a gazillion different color themes and fonts, to really hit it home and honor the app&amp;#39;s original inspiration, Monkeytype?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so I did. Now, I&amp;#39;m looking to find contributors and testers for the early stages of the app (though we already have a couple thousand monthly users, and they seem to be loving the idea so far!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, I need your help.
