Does anyone have any recommendations?\n\nthanks!","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all, happy Friday!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am looking into some AI visibility tools for my agency and am looking for some recomendations. We use Semrush, so I have looked into their AI Toolkit, but since we are on an annual plan, they will charge us $1,200 for data on a single domain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whiel our long-term goal is to have our clients eat this expense, we want a month to month platform to begin testing and and determine if the price is worth the insights. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am looking into Peec AI, but can&amp;#39;t find any non-sponsored videos reviewing the platform.
