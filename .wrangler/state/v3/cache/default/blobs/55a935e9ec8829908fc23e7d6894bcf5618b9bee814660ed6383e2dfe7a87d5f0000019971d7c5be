I understand the technical reasons perfectly, but explaining them in business terms during screen shares has always been challenging. I needed tool that can read my code and help me explain technical decisions in language clients actually understand. When showing database design, it helps me explain how the structure supports scalability and performance. When reviewing API architecture, it translates technical benefits into business value propositions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The change in client relationships has been dramatic.

I don&amp;#39;t have an LLC or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when it comes to which domain to use, and who to address my clients as.. I&amp;#39;m a bit conflicted. I have three domain names purchased:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Brand/business name&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pseudonym using a different surname than my legal one&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My actual name and surnames &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would probably like to use one of the first two, but I&amp;#39;m worried about the legalities and anything tax related. Is it just better to use the domain with my legal name or does it not matter at all?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One consideration is invoices, I imagine I have to put my full legal name on them always.. so it&amp;#39;s kinda weird if I have a Pseudonym, but then when clients get my invoice it has my actual legal name on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also if I were to go with the business name.. is that a bad idea legally? it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m posing as a business while not actually being one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"neetbuck","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nn0dhl/freelancing_and_naming_question/","domain":"self.webdev","score":0,"num_comments":1,"created_utc":1758481082,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nmzhdv","subreddit":"webdev","title":"Help me choose between MSI MAG 274QRF-QD E2 vs G274QRFW","selftext":"I want a 27\" QHD IPS monitor mainly for programming, maybe some gaming later.
