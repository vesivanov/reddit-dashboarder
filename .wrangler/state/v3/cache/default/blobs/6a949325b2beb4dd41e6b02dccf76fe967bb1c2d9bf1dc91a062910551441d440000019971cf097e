No course, no coaching, no agency pitch. **I don't want your money**.\n\nI'm just a guy building Marz (a fully-automated creator platform) who's sick of watching startups torch cash on ads and manual influencer outreach. This is the exact workflow we're using right now to spin up hundreds of creator posts in days and beat paid ads on CAC—steal it.\n\nAll I ask: **try it, then come back and drop your tweaks/results in the comments.**\n\n# The 3-step playbook 👇\n\n**Step 1. Feed the machine the right inputs.**\n\nTraditional approach = scrape CreatorLookup, cold-email 20K leads, pray.\nMarz flips that:\n\n1. Pick your product, geo, and budget inside the dashboard (takes ~3 min).\n2. Our engine auto-pulls **10K–15K qualified micro-creators** (&lt;150 K followers, &gt;5 K avg views, niche match) from IG/TikTok/YouTube.\n3. Dynamic outreach goes out under your brand domain—sequences are auto-personalized (name + niche) and drive creators to a self-serve join link.\n\n👉 Result: we consistently see **45–55 % open, 20 % reply, 8–12 % onboard** with zero human chase. Your only \"manual\" work is approving the creative brief if you want to (optional).\n\n**Step 2. Let programmatic deals do the negotiating for you.**\n\nOld way = back-and-forth DMs, PDF contracts, Net-30.\nNew way:\n\n1.

Spin up a $2 K test budget, target 50 micro-creators, and watch what happens.

Would You Use This?","selftext":"Hey r/SaaS,\n\nSolo founder here—I've got some AI experience from past side hustles, and I'm wrapping up the MVP for **SaaS Shield**, an automated security scanner that catches holes in your site and APIs before they wreck your launch. It's like OWASP Top 10 on steroids, but stupid-simple for us non-security pros.\n\nLook, we've all shipped an MVP, landed a few users, and then—wham—some dumb vuln like XSS or a leaky endpoint blows up your trust (or your bank account). I know the feeling: Last project, I burned a full weekend patching a SQLi that could've been spotted in minutes. Stats don't lie—80% of small sites have these basic exploits, and they hit bootstrappers like us hardest when we're just getting traction. Manual pentests? $5k and a month of waiting. Big tools like Burp? Way too clunky. That's why I built this: AI that safely \"stresses\" your setup, flags the risks, and hands you dead-easy fixes.\n\nHere's the deal in a nutshell:\n- **Frontend Scan**: Toss in your URL—we crawl the pages (playing nice with robots.txt), mimic user clicks and forms, and spot stuff like XSS or CSRF (e.g., \"Your login form's wide open—here's the exact payload that'd break it\").\n- **Backend Break Test**: Give us scoped API access (think OAuth, read-only, expires in an hour)—we fuzz endpoints for injections or auth slips, pulling out vulns like \"SQL dump on /users—lock it down with this snippet.\"\n- **What You Get**: A quick dashboard report in 5-15 minutes, with risk scores, code fixes, and even pivot tips (e.g., \"Shaky auth? Ditch it for JWT before users bail\"). Not a full cert pentest, but it nails 80-90% of the crap that kills early momentum.\n\nEarly birds in? Lifetime free access plus my direct line for feedback—I'm all ears on what'd make this a no-brainer for you.\n\nWould you plug this in weekly pre-launch or during iterations? What's your biggest headache—frontend glitches, API nightmares, or just the whole \"am I secure enough?\" paranoia?

It&amp;#39;s like OWASP Top 10 on steroids, but stupid-simple for us non-security pros.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look, we&amp;#39;ve all shipped an MVP, landed a few users, and then—wham—some dumb vuln like XSS or a leaky endpoint blows up your trust (or your bank account). I know the feeling: Last project, I burned a full weekend patching a SQLi that could&amp;#39;ve been spotted in minutes. Stats don&amp;#39;t lie—80% of small sites have these basic exploits, and they hit bootstrappers like us hardest when we&amp;#39;re just getting traction. Manual pentests? $5k and a month of waiting. Big tools like Burp? Way too clunky. That&amp;#39;s why I built this: AI that safely &amp;quot;stresses&amp;quot; your setup, flags the risks, and hands you dead-easy fixes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the deal in a nutshell:\n- &lt;strong&gt;Frontend Scan&lt;/strong&gt;: Toss in your URL—we crawl the pages (playing nice with robots.txt), mimic user clicks and forms, and spot stuff like XSS or CSRF (e.g., &amp;quot;Your login form&amp;#39;s wide open—here&amp;#39;s the exact payload that&amp;#39;d break it&amp;quot;).\n- &lt;strong&gt;Backend Break Test&lt;/strong&gt;: Give us scoped API access (think OAuth, read-only, expires in an hour)—we fuzz endpoints for injections or auth slips, pulling out vulns like &amp;quot;SQL dump on /users—lock it down with this snippet.&amp;quot;\n- &lt;strong&gt;What You Get&lt;/strong&gt;: A quick dashboard report in 5-15 minutes, with risk scores, code fixes, and even pivot tips (e.g., &amp;quot;Shaky auth? Ditch it for JWT before users bail&amp;quot;). Not a full cert pentest, but it nails 80-90% of the crap that kills early momentum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Early birds in? Lifetime free access plus my direct line for feedback—I&amp;#39;m all ears on what&amp;#39;d make this a no-brainer for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would you plug this in weekly pre-launch or during iterations? What&amp;#39;s your biggest headache—frontend glitches, API nightmares, or just the whole &amp;quot;am I secure enough?&amp;quot; paranoia?

Not because candidates aren't qualified, but because they make the same 5 critical tailoring mistakes over and over.\n\nThe 7-Second Reality Check Studies show recruiters spend an average of 7.4 seconds on initial resume review. Eye-tracking research reveals they look at: Name (1 sec) → Current title (2 sec) → Current company (1.5 sec) → Previous positions (2 sec) → Education (0.9 sec). If you haven't hooked them by then, you're out. Mistake #1: The \"Spray and Pray\" Approach\n\nUsing the same generic resume for every application is career suicide. ATS systems can detect generic resumes instantly, and they're programmed to rank them lower. Your beautifully designed, one-size-fits-all resume? It's probably scoring 20-30% match rate.\n\nReal Example: Marketing Manager Application\n\n❌ Generic Version (30% match):\n\n\"Experienced marketing professional with 5+ years driving brand growth and managing campaigns.\" ✅ Tailored Version (78% match):\n\n\"B2B SaaS Marketing Manager with 5+ years driving product-led growth, specializing in HubSpot automation and Account-Based Marketing (ABM) strategies.\" The tailored version mirrors the exact language from the job posting: \"B2B SaaS,\" \"product-led growth,\" \"HubSpot,\" and \"ABM.\" The Manual Fix:\n\nCreate 3-5 base versions targeting different role types. Here's the framework:\n\n• Version 1: Industry-Specific (e.g., \"SaaS Marketing Manager\") • Version 2: Company-Size Specific (e.g., \"Startup Marketing Manager\") • Version 3: Skill-Specific (e.g., \"Digital Marketing Analytics Manager\") • Version 4: Level-Specific (e.g., \"Senior Marketing Manager\") • Version 5: Function-Specific (e.g., \"Product Marketing Manager\") Then spend 10 minutes customizing from these bases rather than starting from scratch. 🚀 Smart Resume Optimization:\n\nMistake #2: Keyword Stuffing Without Context\n\nYes, keywords matter.

Not because candidates aren&amp;#39;t qualified, but because they make the same 5 critical tailoring mistakes over and over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 7-Second Reality Check Studies show recruiters spend an average of 7.4 seconds on initial resume review. Eye-tracking research reveals they look at: Name (1 sec) → Current title (2 sec) → Current company (1.5 sec) → Previous positions (2 sec) → Education (0.9 sec).

Process breakdown below.\n\nWhen done correctly, this can increase activation rate, retention, conversion rate AND reduce churn - improving all KPIs that boost your SaaS valuation.\n\n**The system (4 steps):**\n\n**1. Track everything with a CDP.** Connect all your SaaS user data sources to track every action. Some that I like: RudderStack, PostHog, Segment, amplitude (has some CDP-like features). CDPs allow you to create a unified customer view where you learn your users key drop off points - crucial for product led growth.\n\n**2. Connect to email platform.** Link to your chosen email marketing platform - my favorite email marketing platforms for SAAS are; Loops so, Customer io &amp; Encharge. Segment users based on actions and current stage. Audience segments are constantly updated via API.\n\n**3. Deploy these 9 core flows.** Value-focused multi-step flows to guide users to the next stage. Not spam - only triggered by what they have/haven't done.\n\n* **Welcome** \\- Coach to first \"Aha!\" moment (Trigger: Account created)\n* **Onboarding** \\- Feature education tied to use-case (Trigger: Key milestone/action completed)\n* **No-Login** \\- Re-engage silent users (Trigger: No login for n days)\n* **Gamification/Progress** \\- Celebrate wins, create momentum (Trigger: Task completion)\n* **Feature Limitation** \\- Highlight premium features (Trigger: Gated feature attempt/ tokens limit reached/near)\n* **Referral** \\- Turn users into advocates (Trigger: Activation milestone)\n* **Cancellation** \\- Rescue at-risk accounts (Trigger: Viewed cancellation page x times)\n* **Abandoned Payment** \\- Recover failed checkouts (Trigger: Checkout started &amp; not completed)\n* **Payment Declined** \\- Prevent involuntary churn (Trigger: Charge failed)\n\nThere will be more flows that are unique to your app though these 9 apply to the majority of SaaS. Other examples of flows you might want to implement to drive product led growth are; testimonial/review request flow, user feedback/survey flow and feature request flows.\n\n**4. A/B test and optimize.** Test messaging at every stage. Route data to dashboards showing which emails drive upgrades and how key SaaS growth metrics improve.\n\n**Example - Simple math to show potential impact:**  \nLet's say you have 100 trial signups → 40% activate → 15% of those convert = 6 paying customers\n\nIf your automated flows boost activation by 20 points: 100 signups → 60% activate → 15% convert = 9 customers (50% increase)\n\nAt scale:  \n1,000 signups: 60 vs 90 paid users  \n10,000 signups: 600 vs 900 paid users\n\n*Note: I'm using 15% activation-to-paid conversion which is conservative - many SaaS see higher rates with proper flows. the purpose of this example is to show the value of increasing activation rates using this system*\n\nAs your product scales, this lever will provide more significant results. This example doesn't touch on other crucial benefits such as; churn reduction, improved feature adoption, higher retention, and increased engagement throughout the customer lifecycle.\n\n**When this works best:** When you have reached product-market fit and have a consistent user acquisition channel where small improvements will begin to compound fast at scale.\n\nI've compiled 500+ real email examples from successful SaaS companies across these flow types (as well as other flow/campaign types) - might be helpful when planning your own flows/emails. let me know if you would like it.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR;&lt;/strong&gt; The answer is automated lifecycle email and in-app messages triggered when users take certain actions within your app to guide them to the next stage of the user journey.

Route data to dashboards showing which emails drive upgrades and how key SaaS growth metrics improve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example - Simple math to show potential impact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nLet&amp;#39;s say you have 100 trial signups → 40% activate → 15% of those convert = 6 paying customers&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your automated flows boost activation by 20 points: 100 signups → 60% activate → 15% convert = 9 customers (50% increase)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At scale:&lt;br/&gt;\n1,000 signups: 60 vs 90 paid users&lt;br/&gt;\n10,000 signups: 600 vs 900 paid users&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I&amp;#39;m using 15% activation-to-paid conversion which is conservative - many SaaS see higher rates with proper flows. the purpose of this example is to show the value of increasing activation rates using this system&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As your product scales, this lever will provide more significant results. This example doesn&amp;#39;t touch on other crucial benefits such as; churn reduction, improved feature adoption, higher retention, and increased engagement throughout the customer lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When this works best:&lt;/strong&gt; When you have reached product-market fit and have a consistent user acquisition channel where small improvements will begin to compound fast at scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve compiled 500+ real email examples from successful SaaS companies across these flow types (as well as other flow/campaign types) - might be helpful when planning your own flows/emails. let me know if you would like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"StrikingAngle882","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nmztvt/how_to_increase_saas_trial_conversions_improve/","domain":"self.SaaS","score":8,"num_comments":6,"created_utc":1758479856,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nmzr2c","subreddit":"SaaS","title":"Saas idea","selftext":"Kids spend hours scrolling TikTok and Instagram, but almost none of that time actually builds their brains.

You'd input a quick app/SaaS description, and it'd handle the heavy lifting:\n\n* **Market Research Automation**: Dives into competitors (like similar apps on stores, their ratings and reviews), checks search trends (using stuff like Google Trends or Ahrefs APIs), and pulls user signals from social media, Reddit threads, forums, and industry sites. It'd highlight opportunities and warn about red flags, like if the space is totally oversaturated.\n* **Technical Roadmap Generation**: Breaks features into a prioritized list, recommends tech stacks (e.g., React Native for cross-platform mobile, Firebase for easy backend), and gives rough timelines (like 4-6 weeks for an MVP).\n* **Idea Scoring System**: Gives it a 1-10 score on market potential, competition level, and tech feasibility – all backed by actual data, not just vibes.\n* **Project Management Features**: Lets you tweak plans, add notes to features, track progress, and maybe sync with tools like Trello or Notion.\n\nBut hey, this is just my rough vision – it could be something totally different.

Chat UI was too limiting. However, we got 1 paying user during our MVP launch leading to some early validation.\n* We started working on our web app focused on control and iteration and launched a month back. Retention jumped immediately.\n\n# Where we’re now\n\n* **4,000+ designers** have signed up on our platform\n* **20000+ renders** created in a month\n* **$2.4k MRR** and growing\n* **100% renewal** by paid users so far\n\n# What worked\n\n1. **Meet designers where they already work -** Supporting **SketchUp/3DS Max** and honoring their materials/structure built instant trust. “Looks accurate” beat “looks AI.”\n2. **Control-first UX -** The shift from WhatsApp to a web tool unlocked iteration: adjust materials, small re‑renders, try angles, compare results. **This drove stickiness.**\n3. **Instagram as a** ***visual*** **channel -** Influencer collaborations + targeted ads performed well for initial traction. Short reels with **before/after** and a clear “model → scene” flow outperformed everything else.\n4. **Listening loops with niche communities -** Posting progress and asking for critique in design subReddits (SketchUp, 3DS Max, architecture) gave higher‑quality feedback than broad “AI” communities.\n\n# What didn’t\n\n* **WhatsApp as the primary interface** for professionals. Great for validation, not great for control.\n* **Underestimating “control.”** Professional designers wanted to have more control on the design rendered rather than getting instant results on chat. We’re adding smaller, faster edit controls like in place edits, masking etc instead of “just prompt it again.”\n* **Instagram Ads.** We tried targeted Insta ads for a couple weeks to get some some early traction but conversion rate wasn’t great so we shifted to influencer collabs.\n\n# A few numbers we’re tracking\n\n* **Time‑to‑first‑render**, **iteration speed**, and **% of scenes accepted without further edits**\n* **Activation → paid user conversion** and **renewal** (still 100% on a small base)\n* **Revenue vs Burn**\n\n# Open questions for r/SaaS \n\n1. **Pricing:** For a tool used per‑project with bursts of iterations, have you found pay-per‑usage or pay-as-you-go plan convert/retain better or should we work out a monthly/annual subscription plan?\n2. **Community vs SEO:** Best way to compound from here — double down on community building or write blogs on **comparison with other AI Tools** or **tutorials/search intent** (“render SketchUp materials accurately”)?\n\nI’m one of the co-founders — happy to answer any questions about the build or growth.

Retention jumped immediately.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Where we’re now&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4,000+ designers&lt;/strong&gt; have signed up on our platform&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20000+ renders&lt;/strong&gt; created in a month&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$2.4k MRR&lt;/strong&gt; and growing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100% renewal&lt;/strong&gt; by paid users so far&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What worked&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet designers where they already work -&lt;/strong&gt; Supporting &lt;strong&gt;SketchUp/3DS Max&lt;/strong&gt; and honoring their materials/structure built instant trust. “Looks accurate” beat “looks AI.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control-first UX -&lt;/strong&gt; The shift from WhatsApp to a web tool unlocked iteration: adjust materials, small re‑renders, try angles, compare results. &lt;strong&gt;This drove stickiness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instagram as a&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;visual&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;channel -&lt;/strong&gt; Influencer collaborations + targeted ads performed well for initial traction. Short reels with &lt;strong&gt;before/after&lt;/strong&gt; and a clear “model → scene” flow outperformed everything else.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listening loops with niche communities -&lt;/strong&gt; Posting progress and asking for critique in design subReddits (SketchUp, 3DS Max, architecture) gave higher‑quality feedback than broad “AI” communities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What didn’t&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WhatsApp as the primary interface&lt;/strong&gt; for professionals. Great for validation, not great for control.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underestimating “control.”&lt;/strong&gt; Professional designers wanted to have more control on the design rendered rather than getting instant results on chat. We’re adding smaller, faster edit controls like in place edits, masking etc instead of “just prompt it again.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instagram Ads.&lt;/strong&gt; We tried targeted Insta ads for a couple weeks to get some some early traction but conversion rate wasn’t great so we shifted to influencer collabs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;A few numbers we’re tracking&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time‑to‑first‑render&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;iteration speed&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;% of scenes accepted without further edits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activation → paid user conversion&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;renewal&lt;/strong&gt; (still 100% on a small base)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue vs Burn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Open questions for &lt;a href=\"/r/SaaS\"&gt;r/SaaS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing:&lt;/strong&gt; For a tool used per‑project with bursts of iterations, have you found pay-per‑usage or pay-as-you-go plan convert/retain better or should we work out a monthly/annual subscription plan?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community vs SEO:&lt;/strong&gt; Best way to compound from here — double down on community building or write blogs on &lt;strong&gt;comparison with other AI Tools&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;tutorials/search intent&lt;/strong&gt; (“render SketchUp materials accurately”)?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m one of the co-founders — happy to answer any questions about the build or growth.

Tried every \"AI builds your app instantly\" tool. Ended up with 47 half-broken prototypes and zero shippable products. Here's what nobody tells you about vibecoding.\n\n**Reality Check:** Spent 200+ hours across 3 months using AI code generators. Initial build: 5 minutes. Making it actually work: 40-80 hours per feature. Debugging cryptic AI-generated code: another 20-30 hours. **Cost:** $400 in AI subscriptions, countless burned weekends. **Lesson:** AI is a powerful tool, not a magic wand. **Tools tested:** Cursor, v0, Bolt, Claude, GitHub Copilot.\n\n# The Harsh Truth About \"1-Click\" App Builders\n\n**1. The demo is always perfect, production never is**\n\nMarketing shows you a beautiful landing page generated in 30 seconds. What they don't show: the 15 hours you'll spend when the CSS breaks on mobile, the form doesn't validate properly, or the database schema makes no sense for your actual use case.\n\n**2. AI doesn't understand your product strategy**\n\nThe generator creates \"a todo app\" or \"a social network.\" But YOUR app needs specific business logic: custom user permissions, particular data relationships, integration with your existing systems. AI gives you a generic starting point, not a strategic product.\n\n**3. The context window is your enemy**\n\nAfter 50 iterations, the AI forgets what you built in iteration 1. You end up with inconsistent code, duplicate functions, and architectural decisions that contradict each other. No coherent vision, just accumulated patches.\n\n**4. Debugging AI code is a special kind of hell**\n\n    // AI generates this:\n    const result = await Promise.all(items.map(async (item) =&gt; {\n      return await processItem(item).catch(e =&gt; null)\n    })).then(r =&gt; r.filter(Boolean))\n    \n    // You spend 3 hours figuring out why items randomly disappear\n    // Turns out: silent error swallowing in production\n    \n\n**5. Feature creep hits differently with AI**\n\nBecause generating new features feels \"free,\" you build everything. No prioritization. No MVP thinking. Just an ever-growing codebase that becomes unmaintainable because you never stopped to ask \"should we build this?\"\n\n# Real Development Timeline (AI-Assisted)\n\n|Task|Promised Time|Actual Time|Why the Gap|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Initial prototype**|5 minutes|5 minutes|AI excels here ✓|\n|**First real feature**|\"Just ask AI\"|8-12 hours|Edge cases, validation, error handling|\n|**Authentication system**|\"Built-in template\"|15-20 hours|Security, sessions, password reset, permissions|\n|**Database optimization**|\"AI knows best practices\"|10-15 hours|AI creates inefficient queries, missing indexes|\n|**Mobile responsiveness**|\"Automatic\"|6-10 hours|AI's CSS breaks on actual devices|\n|**Third-party integrations**|\"Quick API call\"|12-18 hours|OAuth flows, webhooks, rate limiting, error states|\n|**Production debugging**|N/A|20-40 hours|Cryptic AI-generated code with no comments|\n\n**Total:** Promised \"1 hour\" → Reality: **71-120 hours**\n\n# Why Traditional Product Development Still Wins\n\nThe survivor bias is real. You see Twitter threads about \"I built a SaaS in a weekend with AI!\" You don't see the graveyard of abandoned projects or the hidden 80 hours of debugging they don't mention.\n\n**What actually works:**\n\n* **Strategic prompting:** Instead of \"build me X,\" break down your product into clear, isolated features\n* **Iterative development:** Build one complete vertical slice, test it, then move to the next\n* **Prompt management:** Document what works, reuse proven patterns, maintain consistency\n* **Quality over speed:** A well-architected feature takes longer but saves 10x time in maintenance\n\nThis is why I built **Ahead** \\- not another \"instant app\" generator, but a workspace for **disciplined product development** with AI.\n\n# How Ahead Approaches Real Product Development\n\nInstead of promising magic, Ahead focuses on what actually matters:\n\n**1. Strategic organization (Product → Epic → Prompt)** Your app isn't a random collection of features. It's a product with a clear hierarchy. Ahead keeps you focused on what serves your strategy, not what's easy to generate.\n\n**2. Prompt quality over quantity (CLEAR Framework)** Every prompt follows: Context, Length, Examples, Audience, Role. This means AI generates code you can actually understand, maintain, and debug.\n\n**3. Knowledge base for consistency** Store your design system, API patterns, code standards. Every new prompt references this context, so feature 50 doesn't contradict feature 1.\n\n**4. Kanban workflow for real progress** Todo → In Progress → Done. Not an endless backlog of AI-generated ideas, but actual shipped features you can track and prioritize.\n\n**5. Multi-agent workflows for complex features** Queue related prompts, batch-export them. Build a complete feature (frontend + backend + tests) in a coordinated way, not scattered across 20 chat sessions.\n\n# The Unsexy Truth\n\nBuilding quality software with AI takes time. The AI accelerates you from 100 hours to 40 hours, not from 100 hours to 5 minutes.\n\nThe real innovation isn't eliminating the work - it's eliminating the chaos:\n\n* No more lost prompts across browser tabs\n* No more inconsistent code from fragmented context\n* No more feature creep because \"AI makes it easy\"\n* No more debugging cryptic generated code at 2 AM\n\n**This is vibecoding done right:** Fast iteration, but with discipline. AI assistance, but with strategy. Quick shipping, but with quality.\n\n# FAQ\n\n**Aren't you just selling another tool claiming to fix AI development?**\n\nFair question. Ahead doesn't promise to build your app for you. It's a workspace for developers who already know how to code and want to use AI effectively. Think \"GitHub for prompts\" not \"app builder.\"\n\n**What about tools like v0, Bolt, Cursor?**\n\nThey're excellent for specific use cases. v0 for UI components, Cursor for in-editor assistance, Bolt for quick prototypes. Ahead complements them by organizing your entire development strategy, not replacing your code editor.\n\n**How is this different from just using Claude/ChatGPT with good prompts?**\n\nTry managing 100+ prompts across 5 features in a chat interface. No organization, no version control, no strategy. Ahead gives you the structure that chat interfaces can't provide.\n\n**Can beginners use this?**\n\nIf you understand basic programming concepts, yes. But it won't teach you to code - it helps you code better with AI. If you're learning to program, start with fundamentals first.\n\n**What's the actual time savings?**\n\nRealistic estimate: 30-40% reduction in development time through better prompt management and reuse. Not 95% like the hype promises, but enough to ship significantly faster.\n\n**Is this just for solo developers?**\n\nNo - teams benefit more. Shared prompt libraries, consistent code patterns, collaborative knowledge bases. Everyone builds on proven approaches instead of reinventing prompts.\n\n**Pricing?**\n\nFree tier for individuals with core features. Paid plans ($5-15/month) for advanced features, more products, and team collaboration.\n\n**Try Ahead:** Stop building apps in chaos. Start building with strategy → [ahead.love?utm\\_source=reddit&amp;utm\\_medium=post&amp;utm\\_campaign=vibecoding\\_myth](https://ahead.love/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=vibecoding_myth)\n\n*What's your biggest frustration with AI coding tools?

Think &amp;quot;GitHub for prompts&amp;quot; not &amp;quot;app builder.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about tools like v0, Bolt, Cursor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re excellent for specific use cases. v0 for UI components, Cursor for in-editor assistance, Bolt for quick prototypes. Ahead complements them by organizing your entire development strategy, not replacing your code editor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is this different from just using Claude/ChatGPT with good prompts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try managing 100+ prompts across 5 features in a chat interface. No organization, no version control, no strategy. Ahead gives you the structure that chat interfaces can&amp;#39;t provide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can beginners use this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you understand basic programming concepts, yes. But it won&amp;#39;t teach you to code - it helps you code better with AI. If you&amp;#39;re learning to program, start with fundamentals first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s the actual time savings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Realistic estimate: 30-40% reduction in development time through better prompt management and reuse. Not 95% like the hype promises, but enough to ship significantly faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this just for solo developers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No - teams benefit more. Shared prompt libraries, consistent code patterns, collaborative knowledge bases. Everyone builds on proven approaches instead of reinventing prompts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Free tier for individuals with core features. Paid plans ($5-15/month) for advanced features, more products, and team collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try Ahead:&lt;/strong&gt; Stop building apps in chaos.

I'd spend 2-3 hours jumping between different subreddits, copy-pasting interesting posts into Excel sheets, trying to spot business opportunities.\n\nThis process wasn't just inefficient —it was tedious.\n\nThe Problem I Discovered:\n\nPeople always say Reddit is a goldmine —real user pain points, product demands, and market trends emerge naturally in discussions. But the problems were obvious:\n\n1. Information was scattered across dozens of subreddits\n2. No systematic way to track trend changes\n3. Manual analysis was painfully slow\n4. Easy to miss important business signals\n\nThe Decision: Build It Myself\n\nI decided to build a tool to automate this process. How hard could it be, right? I'm a backend developer with 7+ years of experience. APIs, databases, data processing —that's my bread and butter.\n\nLittle did I know I was about to enter frontend hell.\n\nThe Sleepless Nights Begin:\n\nI started working on this after my day job, usually from 9 PM to 2 AM. With all these modern AI tools at my disposal:\n\n1. v0 for component generation\n2. Cursor with AI autocomplete\n3. Claude for code assistance\n\nSurely these would make frontend development a breeze for a backend guy like me, right? Wrong. So incredibly wrong.\n\nI started with v0, and honestly, I was blown away. Within 2 hours, I had generated:\n\n1. A beautiful landing page\n2. A sleek search interface\n3. A modal for displaying results\n4. A dashboard layout\n\nEverything looked gorgeous in the v0 preview. I was thinking \"This AI stuff is magic! I'll have a polished SaaS in a week!\"\n\nI copied all the generated code into my Next.js project and when I put my v0-generated app next to any real SaaS product (Linear, Notion, Stripe), the gap was enormous. It looked like a student project compared to professional software.\n\nThen The Endless Polish Spiral\n\nThis is where I fell into what I now call \"The Polish Trap.\"\n\nI spent the next few weeks in an endless cycle:\n\n1. Stare at my app feeling embarrassed by how amateur it looked\n2. Pick one small thing to \"fix\"\n3. Ask Cursor/Claude to help improve it\n4. Break three other things in the process\n5. Spend hours fixing those broken things\n6. Repeat\n\nWeek 1: The Search Interface Nightmare\n\nThe Problem: My search component looked like a basic HTML form from 2005.\n\nThe Goal: Make it look like Algolia's search or Notion's command palette.\n\nThe Reality:\n\n1. Spent 4 nights just on the input styling\n2. Cursor kept suggesting CSS that worked in isolation but broke the layout\n3. Claude would \"fix\" the padding, breaking the focus states\n4. Every small improvement revealed two new problems\n\nI must have asked \"Why doesn't my search dropdown align properly?\" 50+ times across different AI tools. Each gave different solutions that conflicted with each other.\n\nWeek 2: The Modal Hell\n\nThe Problem: My modals looked unprofessional and had weird behavior.\n\nThe Obsession: I wanted modals that felt as smooth as Linear's or Framer's.\n\nThe Struggle:\n\n1. Z-index wars that Claude couldn't solve consistently\n2. Backdrop blur effects that Cursor generated but broke on Safari\n3. Mobile responsiveness that looked good in one tool's preview but terrible in reality\n4. Scroll-lock behavior that worked sometimes, crashed other times\n\nI spent an entire weekend (16+ hours) just trying to get the modal background overlay to behave properly. Something so basic, yet so frustrating.\n\nWeek 3: The Consistency Nightmare\n\nHere's what the AI tools don't tell you: they all have different styling philosophies.\n\n1. v0 generated components with one approach to spacing and colors.\n2. Cursor auto-completed with different Tailwind patterns.\n3. Claude suggested yet another approach to component structure.\n\nMy codebase became a Frankenstein monster:\n\n* Some buttons used px-4 py-2\n* Others used p-3\n* Some had rounded-md, others rounded-lg\n* Colors were inconsistent across similar components\n\nEvery time I asked an AI tool to \"make this consistent with the rest,\" it would pick its own interpretation of \"consistent.\"\n\nThe Breaking Point\n\nOne night at 1:30 AM, I was debugging why my supposedly \"responsive\" table broke on mobile. I had asked Cursor to fix it 6 times, Claude 4 times, and even tried v0's responsive table generator.\n\nNothing worked properly.\n\nI was ready to quit and just build a basic CRUD interface.\n\nThe Salvation: shadcn/ui\n\nThat's when I discovered shadcn/ui, and it changed everything.\n\nInstead of fighting AI tools to generate consistent components, I had a pre-built design system. The components actually worked together. They had consistent spacing, colors, and behavior.\n\nThe Backend Paradise\n\nAfter 3 weeks of frontend hell, I started working on the backend integration. This is where being a backend developer actually paid off.\n\nWhat took me 3 weeks on frontend, took 1 week on backend:\n\n\\- Reddit API integration: 2 days\n\n\\- Supabase database setup: 1 day\n\n\\- Data processing pipelines: 2 days\n\n\\- OpenAI integration for analysis: 2 days\n\nThe AI tools were actually helpful here:\n\n\\- Claude could write perfect API route handlers\n\n\\- Cursor auto-completed database queries correctly\n\n\\- No styling inconsistencies to worry about\n\nThe Humbling Reality\n\nDespite having access to the best AI tools available, creating a frontend that doesn't scream \"side project\" is incredibly difficult for backend developers.\n\nWhat the AI tools are great at:\n\n\\- Generating boilerplate code quickly\n\n\\- Solving specific, isolated problems\n\n\\- Creating basic component structures\n\nWhat they can't do:\n\n\\- Understand design system consistency across your app\n\n\\- Make cohesive design decisions that feel professional\n\n\\- Handle the hundreds of edge cases in real UIs\n\n\\- Bridge the gap between \"functional\" and \"polished\"\n\nThe Tech Stack That Actually Worked\n\nAfter all the experimentation:\n\n\\- Next.js 15 (App Router) - Powerful once you understand it\n\n\\- Supabase - Made backend work trivial\n\n\\- shadcn/ui - Saved my sanity and frontend career\n\n\\- Tailwind CSS - Works great with a consistent system\n\n\\- OpenAI GPT- For the actual AI analysis\n\nKey Realizations\n\n1. AI tools are code accelerators, not design replacements - They can't teach you design sense\n2. Use a design system from day one - Don't try to build your own aesthetic\n3. Frontend polish takes 3x longer than functionality - Budget accordingly\n4. Consistency beats perfection - Better to have cohesive \"okay\" than scattered \"great\"\n5. The gap between \"works\" and \"professional\" is massive - This is where AI tools fall short\n\nThe Current State\n\nAfter 1 months of 9 PM to 2 AM sessions, I have a functional product that:\n\n* Searches multiple subreddits simultaneously\n* Uses AI to extract business insights\n* Has a responsive design that doesn't embarrass me\n* Actually solves a real problem for users\n\nIs it as polished as Linear or Notion? Not even close. But it's functional, consistent, and valuable.\n\nWhy I'm Sharing This?\n\nThe AI tool hype is real, but it's not magic. The promise of \"anyone can build beautiful apps with AI\" is misleading. You can build functional apps, but the journey from functional to professional is brutal.\n\nFor Fellow Backend Developers:\n\n\\- Budget 4x more time than you think for UI polish\n\n\\- Start with a design system (shadcn/ui saved me)\n\n\\- Accept that your first version will look amateur\n\n\\- AI tools are great for acceleration, terrible for design decisions\n\n\\- The backend integration will be the easy part\n\nThe journey from \"it works\" to \"it looks professional\" is longer and more frustrating than any AI tool suggests. But it's still worth doing.\n\nQuestions welcome! Especially from other backend developers who've survived this journey.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey y/all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just months ago, I was manually browsing Reddit for hours every day, hunting for industry trends for my side project.

Most founders blame \"bad product-market fit\" when the real issue is much simpler to fix.\n\nWorking inside a multi-million dollar SaaS conglomerate with 70+ acquired companies gave me a front-row seat to something most founders never want to talk about: why users actually quit after signing up.\n\nWe'd celebrate new signups, then watch 60-80% of them disappear within 30 days. Leadership always blamed it on \"product-market fit\" or \"wrong customer targeting.\" But when I dug into exit interviews and user behavior data, the truth was much more uncomfortable.\n\nHere are the 7 \"hidden churn killers\" that no SaaS company wants to admit are destroying their retention:\n\n# 1. Confusing Dashboards That Overwhelm Instead of Welcome\n\nYour dashboard is the first impression after signup, yet most look like airplane cockpits. Users land on a page with 15+ widgets, unclear navigation, and no idea what to do first. They came to solve one specific problem, but your dashboard shows them 50 features they don't understand.\n\n**What users actually think:** \"This is too complicated. I'll try something simpler.\"\n\n# 2. Features Not Explained (Because You Assume Users Are Mind Readers)\n\nYou spent months building that amazing feature, so obviously users will understand it instantly, right? Wrong. Users see buttons, menus, and options with no context about what they do or why they matter. Your \"intuitive\" interface only makes sense to people who built it.\n\n**What users actually think:** \"I have no idea what half of these buttons do, and I'm afraid to click them.\"\n\n# 3. No Contextual Help When Users Actually Need It\n\nHelp documentation exists somewhere (buried in a footer link), but users need guidance right when they're stuck, not after hunting through your knowledge base. When they hover over a feature wondering \"what does this do?\" - crickets. No tooltips, no contextual explanations, no guidance.\n\n**What users actually think:** \"I'm stuck and there's no help. This is frustrating.\"\n\n# 4. Reliance on Long Docs Nobody Reads (But You Keep Writing)\n\nYour 47-page user manual is comprehensive and beautifully written. It's also completely useless. Users don't want to read essays about your software - they want to accomplish their goal quickly. Yet companies keep producing more documentation instead of building better guidance into the product itself.\n\n**What users actually think:** \"I'm not reading a novel to use your software. There has to be an easier way.\"\n\n# 5. Delayed Customer Support When Confusion Strikes\n\nNew users have questions within minutes of signing up, but your support team responds in 6-24 hours. By then, the user has already decided your product is too complicated and moved on to a competitor. First-week support response time is make-or-break for retention.\n\n**What users actually think:** \"If I can't get help now, how bad will it be when I'm a paying customer?\"\n\n# 6. Lack of Self-Service Options for Quick Wins\n\nUsers want to feel smart and capable. They don't want to open support tickets for simple tasks, but your product doesn't give them the tools to succeed independently. No interactive guides, no progressive disclosure, no way to learn by doing.\n\n**What users actually think:** \"I feel stupid using this software. Maybe I'm not the target customer.\"\n\n# 7. Users Feel Abandoned After the Initial \"Welcome\" Email\n\nAfter signup, users get a generic welcome email and then... silence. No check-ins, no progress tracking, no celebration of small wins. They're left to figure everything out alone while you focus on acquiring the next batch of signups who will also churn.\n\n**What users actually think:** \"They got my email address and stopped caring. This company doesn't actually want me to succeed.\"\n\n# The Pattern That Kills SaaS Companies\n\nNotice how all 7 killers have the same root cause: **users don't know what to do next.** Your product might be amazing, but if users can't figure out how to get value from it quickly, they'll leave for something that makes them feel capable and supported.\n\nMost SaaS companies try to fix this with more documentation, longer onboarding videos, or additional support staff. But that's treating symptoms, not the disease.\n\n# The Solution That Hits All 7 Problems\n\nAfter seeing this pattern destroy company after company, I realized what was needed: **AI-powered onboarding guides that provide contextual help exactly when users need it.**\n\nHere's how it solves each killer:\n\n1. **Confusing dashboards** → AI guides users to what matters first\n2. **Unexplained features** → Real-time explanations appear when needed\n3. **No contextual help** → Help appears right where users are struggling\n4. **Long docs** → Interactive guidance replaces static documentation\n5. **Delayed support** → Instant AI assistance for common questions\n6. **No self-service** → Users learn by doing with AI coaching\n7. **Feeling abandoned** → Continuous guidance creates supported experience\n\nThe results speak for themselves: Companies using AI onboarding guidance see 40-60% improvement in 30-day retention because users actually understand how to get value from the product.\n\n**UPDATE**: Based on this experience, we've built an AI guidance system that automatically maps your SaaS and provides contextual help exactly when users need it.

Found tools that cut deployment time by 60% and eliminated context-switching hell.\n\n**Results:** Reduced manual task time from 15hrs to 6hrs weekly, improved deployment frequency by 3x, saved $2,400/month in engineering hours. **Cost:** $0-500/month depending on scale. **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks to full implementation. **Stack:** Tested 12 platforms from no-code to developer-first. **Risk:** Poor tool fit can increase complexity—mitigation guide below.\n\n# Method: Evaluating AI Automation Platforms\n\n**1. Define your automation profile** Start by categorizing your needs. Are you connecting APIs? Automating UI tasks on legacy systems? Building AI-powered workflows? Match your technical expertise: no-code user vs. developer who wants custom code access.\n\n**2. Map critical integrations first** List the 10 tools you absolutely need to connect: CRM, databases, communication platforms, AI models. Eliminate any platform that doesn't natively support your core stack. Check for webhook support, API rate limits, and authentication methods.\n\n**3. Calculate true cost per workflow** Don't just look at monthly fees. Calculate cost per task/operation/execution. Factor in: setup time (20-40 hours for complex platforms), maintenance burden, and potential scaling costs.\n\n    True Cost = (Monthly Fee + Setup Hours × $Hourly Rate) / Total Workflows\n    Example: ($99 + 30hrs × $100) / 50 workflows = $62/workflow\n    \n\n**4. Test with a pilot automation** Pick one high-value, repetitive task: syncing data between tools, processing webhooks, generating reports. Build it on 2-3 platforms using free trials. Measure: setup time, reliability, debugging difficulty.\n\n**5. Evaluate developer experience** For technical teams, assess: version control support, custom code capabilities, error handling, observability tools, local development options.\n\n**6. Check governance and security** Enterprise considerations: SSO, role-based access, audit logs, data residency, compliance certifications. Critical for regulated industries.\n\n**7. Measure platform lock-in risk** Can you export workflows? Migrate to another tool? Self-host if needed? Open-source platforms like n8n score highest here.\n\n**8. Review scalability limits** Test edge cases: What happens at 10,000 executions/day? Can it handle concurrent workflows? How does performance degrade under load?\n\n**9. Assess AI-specific capabilities** For AI workflows: token limits, model support (GPT-4, Claude, etc.), vector database integration, prompt management, RAG capabilities.\n\n# Platform Comparison Matrix\n\n|Platform|Best For|Starting Price|Key Strength|Major Limitation|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Ahead**|Developers managing AI prompts|Free tier available|CLEAR framework for prompt quality|Newer platform, some features in development|\n|**Zapier**|No-code users needing broad integrations|$0 (Free tier)|6,000+ app connectors|Task-based pricing gets expensive at scale|\n|**Make**|Visual workflow builders|$9/month|Fine-grained control, affordable|Operations billing hard to predict|\n|**n8n**|Self-hosting, data privacy needs|$20/month cloud|Full code control, no vendor lock-in|Steeper learning curve|\n|**Power Automate**|Microsoft-heavy environments|$15/user/month|Native M365 integration|Complex licensing, MS ecosystem dependent|\n|**Pipedream**|Developer-first API workflows|$29/month|Code blocks + AI token bundles|Credit-based billing requires monitoring|\n|**Workato**|Enterprise agentic AI|Custom quote|Multi-LLM support, AI agents|Enterprise pricing only|\n|**UiPath**|Legacy system automation (RPA)|Contact sales|Desktop/UI automation|High complexity, enterprise-focused|\n\n# Real Implementation Examples\n\n**Example 1: SaaS Product Onboarding (Zapier)**\n\n    Before: 45min manual setup per new customer\n    After: 3min automated workflow\n    Workflow: New Stripe payment → Create user in database → Send welcome email → Add to Slack channel → Generate onboarding tasks\n    Cost: $19/month, saves 7 hours/week\n    \n\n**Example 2: AI-Powered Support Routing (Make)**\n\n    Before: Support tickets manually categorized\n    After: Auto-classified and routed in real-time\n    Workflow: Zendesk ticket → AI sentiment analysis → Extract key entities → Route to specialist → Update CRM\n    Cost: $9/month + AI API costs, saves 12 hours/week\n    \n\n**Example 3: Developer Prompt Management (Ahead)**\n\n    Before: Prompts scattered across docs/tabs\n    After: Centralized library with CLEAR framework\n    Workflow: Kanban prompt queue → Copy to clipboard → Auto-track in \"In Progress\" → Archive when done\n    Cost: Free tier, saves 5+ hours/week avoiding prompt reinvention\n    \n\n**Example 4: Data Pipeline Automation (n8n - Self-hosted)**\n\n    Before: Manual CSV processing and database syncs\n    After: Event-driven data transformation\n    Workflow: S3 file upload → Parse CSV → Transform with custom Python → Validate → Load to Postgres → Notify team\n    Cost: $40/month hosting, saves 20 hours/week\n    \n\n# Decision Framework\n\n**Choose Zapier/Make if:**\n\n* Non-technical team members need to build automations\n* You need maximum app connectivity (6,000+ options)\n* Budget is limited but needs are simple\n* Visual workflow builder is essential\n\n**Choose n8n/Pipedream if:**\n\n* You're a developer who wants code-level control\n* Self-hosting or data privacy is critical\n* You need custom logic with JavaScript/Python\n* Open-source flexibility matters\n\n**Choose Power Automate/UiPath if:**\n\n* You're deep in Microsoft/enterprise ecosystem\n* You need to automate legacy desktop applications\n* Governance and compliance are non-negotiable\n* RPA (robotic process automation) is required\n\n**Choose Ahead if:**\n\n* You're a developer using AI coding tools daily\n* You need structured prompt management\n* Multi-agent workflows are your focus\n* CLEAR framework for quality prompts appeals\n\n# FAQ\n\n**How do I avoid vendor lock-in?** Prioritize platforms with export capabilities, open APIs, or self-hosting options. Document your workflows in plain language. Use platforms like n8n (open-source) or build critical workflows in multiple tools as backup.\n\n**What's the real cost at scale?** Calculate based on execution volume, not just monthly fees. Example: Zapier at 50k tasks/month = $600+. n8n self-hosted = $50/month regardless of volume. Always factor in hidden costs: setup time, maintenance, troubleshooting hours.\n\n**Can I combine multiple platforms?** Yes, and often recommended. Use Zapier for simple triggers, Pipedream for complex API work, Ahead for prompt management. They can trigger each other via webhooks.\n\n**How long does implementation take?** Simple automations: 1-2 hours. Complex multi-step workflows: 20-40 hours including testing and error handling. Budget 2-4 weeks for team adoption and iteration.\n\n**What about AI token costs?** Most platforms charge separately for AI API calls. Pipedream includes token bundles. Calculate: avg tokens per run × runs per month × $cost per 1k tokens. Example: 2k tokens × 1000 runs × $0.002 = $4/month.\n\n**Security and compliance concerns?** Enterprise platforms (Workato, Power Automate, UiPath) have SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR certifications. Self-hosted n8n gives you full control. Always encrypt sensitive data, use environment variables for API keys, enable audit logging.\n\n**How do I measure ROI?** Track: hours saved per week, error reduction rate, deployment frequency increase, manual task elimination. Formula: `(Hours Saved × Hourly Rate - Tool Cost) / Tool Cost = ROI %`. Aim for 300%+ ROI in first quarter.\n\n**Edit (2025-09-21):** Added Ahead as #1 choice for developer prompt management after team testing. Updated Pipedream pricing based on new token bundles. Next update will include Retool Agents performance benchmarks.\n\n*Built your own automation stack? Drop your setup and monthly costs below. Struggling to choose between platforms?

Our best-performing creative often comes from those \"happy accident\" moments when someone has bandwidth to experiment. But those moments are rare when you're constantly firefighting performance dips.\n\nI'm curious - has anyone cracked the code on this? Specifically looking for:\n\n* Sustainable workflows that don't require your designers to pull all-nighters every campaign refresh\n* Performance prediction methods - any early warning systems for when creative is about to plateau?\n* Team structure insights - should we be hiring more designers, or are we approaching this wrong?\n* Tool recommendations - AI-assisted design, automation platforms, anything that's actually moved the needle for you\n\nAlso wondering if this is just the new reality of digital advertising, or if we're missing something fundamental about audience fatigue patterns in SaaS specifically.

I call it Vocabulary WALLET (Not the actual name) , and am looking for genuine feedback before we launch.\n\nThe Problem with Learning Words\n\nWe’ve all been there: you’re reading something interesting, you find a cool word, and you save it. But then what? The word just sits on a lifeless list. Flashcards help, but they’re often boring and you quickly forget the context.\n\nThe real Solution: \nThe Vocabulary Wallet\nWe're building a tool that's much more than just a list. It's an ecosystem designed to make words actually stick\n\n * Capture Anything, Anywhere: See a word on a website? Just highlight and click a short key to save it. Hear a word in a podcast? Speak it into your phone. It goes directly into your wallet.\n\n * The system instantly grabs the definition, how to say it, and example sentences so you understand it immediately.\n\n *Spaced Reviews (The unique selling point) - It uses a smart system to remind you to review words right before you’re about to forget them (planning to implement with email and WhatsApp chat sending the users daily news feeds using the words from vocabulary wallet or anything (still brainstorming) ) \n\n The Game-Changer: This is what we think makes us different. Every night, our tool creates a personalized story, a short news brief, or even a little podcast episode using the words you’ve recently saved.

I call it Vocabulary WALLET (Not the actual name) , and am looking for genuine feedback before we launch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Problem with Learning Words&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been there: you’re reading something interesting, you find a cool word, and you save it. But then what? The word just sits on a lifeless list. Flashcards help, but they’re often boring and you quickly forget the context.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real Solution: \nThe Vocabulary Wallet\nWe&amp;#39;re building a tool that&amp;#39;s much more than just a list. It&amp;#39;s an ecosystem designed to make words actually stick&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capture Anything, Anywhere: See a word on a website? Just highlight and click a short key to save it. Hear a word in a podcast? Speak it into your phone. It goes directly into your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system instantly grabs the definition, how to say it, and example sentences so you understand it immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Spaced Reviews (The unique selling point) - It uses a smart system to remind you to review words right before you’re about to forget them (planning to implement with email and WhatsApp chat sending the users daily news feeds using the words from vocabulary wallet or anything (still brainstorming) ) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Game-Changer: This is what we think makes us different. Every night, our tool creates a personalized story, a short news brief, or even a little podcast episode using the words you’ve recently saved. The idea is to make sure you see and hear your new words in a real, engaging context so they become part of your vocabulary, not just a list entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why We Think It&amp;#39;s Different\nMost tools do one thing well—either capturing words or making flashcards.

A little over 50% of them completed the user journey and generated between 1 to 5 ads. The other half signed up to the free account but did not complete the workflow. Zero ad generations. My free account sign up allows users to generate upto 10 free ads.\n\nSign up numbers are directly proportional to the time and effort invested in Reddit.\nPart of me is happy that free sign ups are climbing steady in the 2nd week but the other part of me is worried that I haven't got a single paid user yet. Have sent emails to everyone who signed up. Haven't heard back from anyone.\n\nDon't know what early users think about the user journey, but read to make any and all improvements that could bring value to the Ad creation process of solopreneurs and small biz through [myadlab.ai](https://myadlab.ai)\n\nIf my mission resonates with you, please have a look at [myadlab.ai](https://myadlab.ai) and let me know what you think about current ad creation workflow and any changes you'd like. \n\nSPECIAL OFFER:\nFor the first 10 people who are willing to give myadlab.ai a shot, I'll generate free ad creative for your next ad campaign. I won't stop until the creatives fully meet your satisfaction. Comment below if you're interested.\n\nJust to clarify, there are no strings attached and no hidden agenda. If we ended up working together for your ad campaign, you won't have any obligations to become a paid user of myadlab.ai. I'm after your feedback not your money. My achievement would be to create value for you through myadlab.ai not getting you on board as a paid user.

A little over 50% of them completed the user journey and generated between 1 to 5 ads. The other half signed up to the free account but did not complete the workflow. Zero ad generations. My free account sign up allows users to generate upto 10 free ads.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sign up numbers are directly proportional to the time and effort invested in Reddit.\nPart of me is happy that free sign ups are climbing steady in the 2nd week but the other part of me is worried that I haven&amp;#39;t got a single paid user yet. Have sent emails to everyone who signed up. Haven&amp;#39;t heard back from anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t know what early users think about the user journey, but read to make any and all improvements that could bring value to the Ad creation process of solopreneurs and small biz through &lt;a href=\"https://myadlab.ai\"&gt;myadlab.ai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If my mission resonates with you, please have a look at &lt;a href=\"https://myadlab.ai\"&gt;myadlab.ai&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you think about current ad creation workflow and any changes you&amp;#39;d like. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SPECIAL OFFER:\nFor the first 10 people who are willing to give myadlab.ai a shot, I&amp;#39;ll generate free ad creative for your next ad campaign. I won&amp;#39;t stop until the creatives fully meet your satisfaction. Comment below if you&amp;#39;re interested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just to clarify, there are no strings attached and no hidden agenda.

Then I used some offers such as the Samsung offer for something like 50GB storage for a year, but still got back to the free plan. I wasn't ready yet. \n\nAs a broke student with some small gig work I couldn't afford to pay the subscription, and I always had just about enough space - I mainly used it for PDFs and Office documents as well as some art and music projects I was making. Occasionally I would have to swap out the docs I didn't use, delete the duplicates to have at least 500-600 MB of space, but it wasn't a big inconveniece - more of a regular decluttering task.\n\nIn the last couple of years, when I got into different projects and started to actually get paid for the things I design and develop (and quite well at that), I started to get some SaaS subscriptions here and there - design, coding, edtech apps, even some things for hobbies, etc. My monthly digital subscription bill started to approach 200 bucks, but I still didn't pay for Dropbox because I felt I had enough. Additionally, if I had some bigger files to transfer, I could use my own FTP, free Google Drive or One Drive that my employer is paying for.\n\nFinally, this week I designed a large project for a CEO of a bank and realized that I can't store all of the files, including media, in the same Dropbox. Also, my new data mining project requires me to swap large amounts of data from one computer to another, I also use it on mobile. \n\nSo I decided to look for deals on Dropbox and found one which had 40% off if you pay with VISA (not hard to fulfil - previously I tried to use the Lenovo discount offer, but it didn't work) and boom - I got the annual subscription 14 years later!\n\nOf course, this example is a ridiculously long one, but I am absolutely sure that it can be extrapolated to see how buying decisions are made.\n\nHere are my takeaways - pretty obvious stuff, but interesting to look at from a distant perspective:\n\n1) For many types of SaaS the free tier is crucial - something limited but actually useful is much better than a 30-day trial for retention and future sales.\n\n2) As they emphasize in YC, having a built-in share function is important. And again, in Dropbox it is done in a very organic way - you refer people and get more MB of space, not something less tangible like \"10% off your next purchase when your friend signs up\".\n\n3) Retention and user loyalty matter. Ideally, you want to have a service that will become irreplaceable for your user. \nUsing Dropbox for such a long time allowed me to test it and compare it to other solutions from different companies. Services like these also don't have to remind you to use them and spam emails and notifications - you are already using them because you need them daily.\n\n4) Life and business situations change - why do you think a lot of companies offer student subscriptions at huge discounts and even for free? Because they want people to get used to their software and then, when the time is right, to purchase expensive licenses. The same can be true for B2B and other types of SaaS - it can start with curiousty, and when the actual problem arises, you can finally make a sale - maybe in several months or even years!\n\n5) Sometimes there should be one little push to help your user make that step, and for me it was the 40% off coupon, which brought the annual subscription from the psychological mark of $100 to a more manageable one.\n\nI hope it was useful.

It was popularized by Mark Lou’s Shipfast and is used all around because is effective. But it is actually a copywiting formula, and there are a lot more from where that came from and just as effective.\n\nI’ve been a designer for around 20 years, also I’m a marketer and developer. Used to work for years rebuilding websites for improving conversions. Here I’m disclosing some of the most powerful copywriting formulas I’ve compiled, with the psychological principles they leverage, so you can avoid using technical, vague or confusing copy that cost you conversions.\n\nHere’s my personal arsenal:\n\n**---**\n\n**Hero titles formulas:**\n\n**1. Get \\[result\\] + \\[easily / quickly / without effort\\]** — Principle: Instant Gratification. \n\n*\"Ship your startup + in days, not weeks\"*\n\n*\"Generate qualified leads + on autopilot”*\n\n**Why it works:** This formula appeals to our desire for speed and efficiency, promising the desired outcome with minimal effort.\n\n**2. \\[Product\\] + used by \\[authority figure\\]** — Principle: Social Proof.\n\n*\"Figma is trusted by design teams at Google, Microsoft, and Apple\"*\n\n*\"The world's fastest-growing startups + run on Chromatic”*\n\n**Why it works:** It’s a shortcut to creating trust by leveraging the credibility of respected figures or brands, signaling the product is safe and effective.\n\n**3. \\[Remove problem\\] + forever** — Principle: Problem Finality. \n\n*\"Eliminate procrastination + once and for all\"*\n\n*“End customer churn + permanently\"*\n\n**Why it works:** It targets the desire to permanently eliminate a recurring pain point, offering complete relief and peace of mind.\n\n**4. Get \\[result\\] + \\[avoid loss\\]** — Principle: Loss Aversion. \n\n*\"Deploy code 10x faster + without breaking production”*\n\n*\"Grow your audience + without sacrificing quality\"*\n\n**Why it works:** This formula leverages the psychological desire of avoiding a loss rather than gaining an advantage.\n\n**5. Get \\[result\\] + without doing \\[this hard thing\\]** — Principle: Pain Point Removal. \n\n*\"Build your audience + without spending hours on social media\"*\n\n*\"Keep your team in sync + without the back-to-back meetings\"*\n\n**Why it works:** This works by explicitly removing the single most difficult part of a process, creating a strong sense of relief.\n\n**---**\n\n**Hero Subtitles formulas:**\n\n**1. \\[Feature\\] + \\[Advantage\\] + \\[Benefit\\]** — Principle: Logical Progression. \n\n*“Automated community member tagging + that identifies your biggest fans + so you can build stronger relationships and launch ambassador programs”*\n\n*\"With our unique one-click deployment previews + your whole team can review changes instantly + letting you ship flawless code faster.\"*\n\n**Why it works:** This formula connects in a logical sequence a feature (what it is) to its advantage (how it works) and finally to the user's desired outcome (why they care).\n\n**2. \\[Before\\] + \\[After\\] + \\[Bridge\\]** — Principle: Contrast &amp; Transformation. \n\n*\"Your content ideas are scattered across notes, docs, and DMs. + Imagine a single visual calendar with every post planned and scheduled. + ContentGrid makes it happen.”*\n\n*\"Your team’s best ideas are buried in Slack, never to be seen again. + What if they were all captured in a searchable, intelligent wiki? + Turn chaos into knowledge with us.”*\n\n**Why it works:** This highlights the contrast between the user's current pain and their desired future, logically positioning the product as the obvious path (Bridge) between the two.\n\n**3. \\[Feature\\] + \\[So what?\\]** — Principle: Value Translation. \n\n*\"Our platform uses a global edge network + so your website loads instantly for every user, worldwide.”*\n\n*\"BrandSpark.AI generates a complete brand kit from a single text prompt + so you can have a professional logo, colors, and fonts in under 60 seconds.”*\n\n**Why it works:** It directly answers the user's unspoken question, \"So what?\", by translating a product feature or technical detail into its most direct and tangible benefit.\n\n**4. \\[Problem\\] + \\[Agitation\\] + \\[Solution\\]** — Principle: Emotional Escalation &amp; Resolution. \n\n*\"Still manually posting to every social platform? Are you wasting hours just copy-pasting? OmniPost schedules a week of content in the time it takes to write one tweet.”*\n\n*\"Lost another top engineering candidate? Is your slow, clunky hiring process costing you talent? We streamline technical interviews so you can make great hires, faster.”*\n\n**Why it works:** This formula identifies a problem, intensifies the emotional pain associated with it (Agitation), and then presents the product as a satisfying solution.\n\n**5. \\[Product\\] + \\[Credibility\\] + \\[Solution\\]** — Principle: Authority by Association. \n\n*\"PodPilot is the AI show notes writer + used by the hosts of 'My First Million' + to turn hours of audio into perfect summaries instantly.”*\n\n*\"The design tool + used to build the Pitch and Notion brands + for creating an unforgettable visual identity.”*\n\n**Why it works:** It builds instant credibility by connecting the product with a trusted brand, figure, or metric, allowing you to \"borrow\" their authority and validate your solution.\n\n**6. \\[Product\\] + \\[Benefit Chaining\\] + \\[Hook\\]** — Principle: Aspirational Identity. \n\n*\"No more blank pages. No more fighting for the right word. Just pure flow. This is writing, supercharged by AI.”*\n\n*\"One blog post becomes ten tweets. One video becomes five viral clips. Your content calendar, full for a month. This is how you stop creating and start publishing.”*\n\n**Why it works:** It combines multiple benefits to create a vivid picture of a desired result, allowing the user to get a better understanding of the solution.\n\n**---**\n\n**Nudges:** The microcopy that surrounds the call-to-action. These nudges are designed to overcome last-second hesitation and give the user that final push of confidence or urgency they need.\n\n**1**. **Put \\[this product / service\\] to work for you right now** — Principle: Agency and Immediacy.\n\n*“Put ReelyAI to work for you and turn your best blog posts into a week's worth of content right now.”*\n\n**Why it works:** It frames the product as an active assistant ready to start immediately.\n\n**2. Don’t take my word for it, see \\[product / service\\] work for yourself** — Principle: Risk Reversal.\n\n*“Don’t take our word for it, see MockupMagic turn your boring screenshots into marketing assets for yourself.”*\n\n**Why it works:** This one encourages the user to verify the claims.\n\n**3. The sooner you act, the sooner you’ll \\[get result\\]** — Principle: Direct Causality.\n\n*“The sooner you* *launch your page with Maze, the sooner you’ll start building your waitlist.”*\n\n**Why it works:** Links the action of signing up with their desired outcome.\n\n**4. All you have to do is \\[get Product\\] to start \\[getting results\\]** — Principle: Simplicity.\n\n*“All you have to do is upload your webinar to start getting dozens of shareable clips.”*\n\n**Why it works:** It reduces the perceived effort and makes the next step feel easy and obvious.\n\n**5. If you liked \\[this thing\\], then you’ll love \\[this other thing\\], where you’ll get \\[more benefits\\]** — Principle: Value Stacking.\n\n*“If you liked our list of 10 viral hooks, then you’ll love TrendGen, where you’ll get unlimited ideas perfectly matched to your niche.”*\n\n**Why it works:** It anchors the good feeling of the value received to the next offer to be presented.\n\n**6. Take the next step by clicking here to get \\[this other thing\\]** — Principle: Clear Direction.\n\n*“Take the next step by clicking here to get your free community launch checklist.”*\n\n**Why it works:** It provides an explicit, low-friction command for what to do next.\n\n**7. If you’d rather slash your \\[results time\\], then you’ll want to \\[get this thing\\]** — Principle: Efficiency and Time Saving.\n\n*“If you’d rather slash your design time from an hour to a minute, then you’ll want to try LayoutAI.”*\n\n**Why it works:** It targets the desire to achieve goals faster and with less effort.\n\n**8. Do you want \\[this result?\\], then \\[register / subscribe\\] to get more info** — Principle: Qualifying Question.\n\n*“Want a brand story that actually connects with customers? Subscribe for a free brand story template.”*\n\n**Why it works:** It directly asks the user if they want the benefit, then provides the clear action to get it.\n\n**---**\n\n**Urgency:** Also to be used around calls to action to provide a final push for the visitor to pull the trigger.\n\n**1. Ends Tomorrow** — Principle: The 24-hour deadline.\n\n*“Your 50% discount on the Pro Plan* ***Ends Tomorrow.***”\n\n**Why it works:** It's the perfect balance of giving someone a little time to think while creating a powerful push to act now.\n\n**2. Limited Time Only** — Principle: Vague scarcity.\n\n*“Get our Sleep &amp; Focus audio bundles for the price of one.* ***Limited Time Only.****”*\n\n**Why it works:** It implies the offer could disappear at any moment without a specific deadline, creating some pressure to act.\n\n**3. One-Time Offer** — Principle: Uniqueness and Irreversibility.\n\n*“Get a free 1-on-1 growth strategy session with your annual plan.* ***One-Time Offer*** *for new members.”*\n\n**Why it works:** This signals that this specific deal will never be available again, leveraging fear of permanent loss.\n\n**4. Expires Soon** — Principle: Imminent Loss.\n\n*“Your 40% launch discount* ***Expires Soon.****”*\n\n**Why it works:** This works well in contexts like emails or banners where the exact timing is less critical, but the pressure is still on.\n\n**5. Warning:** — Principle: Pattern Interrupt.\n\n\\*“\\****Warning:*** *Your early-adopter discount will be removed from your account in 24 hours.”*\n\n**Why it works:** This word is a powerful attention-grabber that breaks through banner blindness and signals important, time-sensitive information.\n\n***6. Only \"X\" Units Left*** *—* Principle: Quantity Scarcity.\n\n*“We are only offering 100 lifetime licenses at this price.* ***Only 25 left!****”*\n\n**Why it works:** It creates social proof and competition. “Units” can be beta spots, coaching slots, or lifetime deals.\n\n**7. Only \"X\" Days Left** — Principle: Countdown Clock.\n\n\\*\"\\****Only 3 Days Left*** *to join our New Year's cohort.”*\n\n**Why it works:** This creates a tangible and ever-decreasing timeline, making the end of the offer feel more concrete each day.\n\n**8. Ends Today** — Principle: Maximum Immediacy.\n\n*“Join the 30-day challenge and get our goal-setting workbook for free. Offer* ***Ends Today.****”*\n\n**Why it works:** This is a strong urgency nudge, forcing an immediate decision. Ideal for the final day of a promotion.\n\n**9. Last Chance** — Principle: Finality.\n\n***\"Last Chance*** *to claim your free personalized skin analysis with a Pro subscription.”*\n\n**Why it works:** This one frames the decision as the final opportunity, triggering a powerful sense of FOMO.\n\n**10. Offer Ends \"X\"** — Principle: Specificity.\n\n*“Get our \"About Us\" page generator included for free.* ***Offer Ends Friday at Midnight PST.****”*\n\n**Why it works:** Naming a specific date and time makes the deadline feel official and non-negotiable, removing any ambiguity.\n\n**---**\n\n**Tip:** Feed the examples you like to your favorite LLM with your business info and let it create several titles, subtitles, features and copy elements for your SaaS. I guarantee you’ll improve your results!\n\nHope this is useful for improving your SaaS Landing page.

Don’t take my word for it, see [product / service] work for yourself&lt;/strong&gt; — Principle: Risk Reversal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Don’t take our word for it, see MockupMagic turn your boring screenshots into marketing assets for yourself.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; This one encourages the user to verify the claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The sooner you act, the sooner you’ll [get result]&lt;/strong&gt; — Principle: Direct Causality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The sooner you&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;launch your page with Maze, the sooner you’ll start building your waitlist.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Links the action of signing up with their desired outcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. All you have to do is [get Product] to start [getting results]&lt;/strong&gt; — Principle: Simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“All you have to do is upload your webinar to start getting dozens of shareable clips.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; It reduces the perceived effort and makes the next step feel easy and obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. If you liked [this thing], then you’ll love [this other thing], where you’ll get [more benefits]&lt;/strong&gt; — Principle: Value Stacking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If you liked our list of 10 viral hooks, then you’ll love TrendGen, where you’ll get unlimited ideas perfectly matched to your niche.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; It anchors the good feeling of the value received to the next offer to be presented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Take the next step by clicking here to get [this other thing]&lt;/strong&gt; — Principle: Clear Direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Take the next step by clicking here to get your free community launch checklist.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; It provides an explicit, low-friction command for what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. If you’d rather slash your [results time], then you’ll want to [get this thing]&lt;/strong&gt; — Principle: Efficiency and Time Saving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If you’d rather slash your design time from an hour to a minute, then you’ll want to try LayoutAI.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; It targets the desire to achieve goals faster and with less effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Do you want [this result?], then [register / subscribe] to get more info&lt;/strong&gt; — Principle: Qualifying Question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Want a brand story that actually connects with customers? Subscribe for a free brand story template.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; It directly asks the user if they want the benefit, then provides the clear action to get it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urgency:&lt;/strong&gt; Also to be used around calls to action to provide a final push for the visitor to pull the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Ends Tomorrow&lt;/strong&gt; — Principle: The 24-hour deadline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Your 50% discount on the Pro Plan&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ends Tomorrow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s the perfect balance of giving someone a little time to think while creating a powerful push to act now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Limited Time Only&lt;/strong&gt; — Principle: Vague scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Get our Sleep &amp;amp; Focus audio bundles for the price of one.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Limited Time Only.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; It implies the offer could disappear at any moment without a specific deadline, creating some pressure to act.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. One-Time Offer&lt;/strong&gt; — Principle: Uniqueness and Irreversibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Get a free 1-on-1 growth strategy session with your annual plan.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;One-Time Offer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;for new members.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; This signals that this specific deal will never be available again, leveraging fear of permanent loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Expires Soon&lt;/strong&gt; — Principle: Imminent Loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Your 40% launch discount&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expires Soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; This works well in contexts like emails or banners where the exact timing is less critical, but the pressure is still on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; — Principle: Pattern Interrupt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*“*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Your early-adopter discount will be removed from your account in 24 hours.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; This word is a powerful attention-grabber that breaks through banner blindness and signals important, time-sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. Only &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; Units Left&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; Principle: Quantity Scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We are only offering 100 lifetime licenses at this price.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only 25 left!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; It creates social proof and competition. “Units” can be beta spots, coaching slots, or lifetime deals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Only &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; Days Left&lt;/strong&gt; — Principle: Countdown Clock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*&amp;quot;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only 3 Days Left&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;to join our New Year&amp;#39;s cohort.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; This creates a tangible and ever-decreasing timeline, making the end of the offer feel more concrete each day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Ends Today&lt;/strong&gt; — Principle: Maximum Immediacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Join the 30-day challenge and get our goal-setting workbook for free. Offer&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ends Today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a strong urgency nudge, forcing an immediate decision. Ideal for the final day of a promotion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Last Chance&lt;/strong&gt; — Principle: Finality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Last Chance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;to claim your free personalized skin analysis with a Pro subscription.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; This one frames the decision as the final opportunity, triggering a powerful sense of FOMO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Offer Ends &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; — Principle: Specificity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Get our &amp;quot;About Us&amp;quot; page generator included for free.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Offer Ends Friday at Midnight PST.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Naming a specific date and time makes the deadline feel official and non-negotiable, removing any ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Feed the examples you like to your favorite LLM with your business info and let it create several titles, subtitles, features and copy elements for your SaaS.

Here's the one insight that could save your company hundreds of thousands.**\n\nHey r/SaaS, this story might save you from making the same expensive mistake I watched happen for years.\n\nFor the past 7 years, I worked inside a multi-million dollar SaaS giant that had acquired over 70 SaaS businesses under their portfolio. What I witnessed there completely changed how I think about customer support - and it's probably happening in your company right now.\n\nPicture this: We had separate support teams for each of the 70+ companies. Hundreds of support reps across different time zones, The ticket volume was insane - thousands per day across the portfolio. On paper, it looked like we were providing amazing customer service. In reality, we were hemorrhaging money.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting. During lunch breaks, I'd chat with support team colleagues, and they kept telling me, \"Dude, most of our day is pretty chill. We just answer the same how-to questions over and over.\" One rep told me, \"I swear, 70% of the tickets I get are literally answered in the user manual, but people don't want to read - they just want to click and ask.\"\n\nThat's when it hit me. We had this massive, expensive machine designed to answer questions that users could solve themselves if we just guided them properly. But why would a user spend 10 minutes reading documentation when they could get an answer in 2 clicks?\n\nSo I started digging into the numbers, and what I found was shocking. The SAAS industry average cost per support ticket is $22, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. When you factor in training overhead (2-3 months to get a rep productive), context switching between tickets, escalation chains, and the churn that happens when response times lag - the real cost was closer to $50-70 per ticket.\n\nDo the math: If you're handling 1,000 tickets per month, that's not $22K in support costs - it's potentially $50-70K when you include all the hidden expenses. Scale that across 70 companies, and you're looking at millions in what I realized was largely preventable spending.\n\nBut here's the kicker - most of these tickets weren't complex technical issues. They were simple \"how do I do X\" questions that could be solved with proper guidance at the right moment.\n\nThat realization sparked an idea. What if instead of waiting for users to get confused and create tickets, we could guide them proactively? What if AI could detect when a user was about to get stuck and provide contextual help right then and there?\n\nI started researching walkthrough AI and proactive guidance systems. But here's what I found, most solutions in the market were just chatbots or basic video walkthrough systems. Nothing truly proactive that could understand user behavior and provide guidance before they got stuck.\n\nThat's when I realized we needed to build something different. Based on this experience, we actually started developing our own AI guidance system. Here's how it works: Once you give the AI access to your SaaS, it automatically explores and maps out your entire application, identifying all the workflows and procedures. If you have existing guide documents or manuals, you can feed those in as well to enhance its understanding.\n\nThe AI then learns to identify user needs and behavior patterns in real-time. It handles everything automatically. The AI displays guidance as a chat window at the bottom right corner of the screen and helps users complete tasks without ever needing to open a support ticket. It's like having a smart assistant that knows exactly what the user is trying to do and guides them on how to do it.\n\nWhen I looked at companies implementing this approach, the numbers were incredible:\n\n* 50-70% reduction in how-to support tickets\n* Faster user onboarding and adoption\n* Support teams could focus on actual technical issues instead of answering the same questions repeatedly\n* ROI typically breaks even within 2-3 months\n\nThe math is simple: If you're spending $50K monthly on support for basic how-to questions, and you can prevent 60% of those tickets with an AI guidance system, you're saving $30K monthly starting in month 3. That's $360K annually.\n\nBut most SaaS founders I talk to are still thinking \"we just need more support people.\" They're scaling the symptom instead of solving the problem.\n\nEvery support ticket represents a moment where your product failed to guide the user. Instead of building bigger support teams, build better guidance systems.\n\nIf you're running a SaaS and constantly hiring support reps to handle ticket volume, ask yourself, How many of those tickets could be prevented with the right guidance at the right moment? I guarantee it's more than you think.\n\nWhat's your experience been with support costs? Anyone else noticed this pattern in their company?\n\n**UPDATE:** Based on this experience, we've actually built the AI guidance system I described above. Just launched our waitlist for SaaS companies looking to cut their support costs by 50-70%.

They shut down accounts left and right, with money still in them, which you never see again. And most often without explanation, there are people who didn’t even break the terms.

So that’s a no, I don’t want to spend six months to earn $2,000 and then never see it.\n\nTemu:\n\nIn short, they offer good commission payouts, but the problem is with the model they chose. A referral only qualifies if the person never had the Temu app installed, installs it through your link, and places an order within 30 days. In other words, if they visit your site and browse from their browser, tough luck. Same if they go through your link and buy the product but already have the app installed. Basically, the chances of making money with their affiliate program drop to near zero because a lot of people already have the app. So again, pass, waste of time.\n\nAmazon Associates:\n\nYou’d think that because of the Amazon brand, this would be solid and profitable. Nothing could be further from the truth. Despite Amazon’s growing profits over the last 15 years, affiliate commissions have been steadily dropping since 2012. From what I’ve read, you basically earn coffee money with how poorly they pay.

(Get specific - money lost, time wasted, crazy pivots, sleepless nights, inner doubts.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Looking back: What have you thrown at this problem - what almost helped, or blew up in your face?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you could erase this pain for good, how would it actually change your business? Paint the best-case scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No dumb polls, no product hunting, no “would you use…” BS - just battle stories and the real impact chasing growth can have.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe another person has already been through a struggle you are in right now. Let&amp;#39;s help each other.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what’s your story about the journey of acquiring customers and keeping them active?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"Extension_Pitch9081","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nlymk0/whats_the_real_untold_story_behind_your_toughest/","domain":"self.SaaS","score":1,"num_comments":2,"created_utc":1758376028,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nlyix8","subreddit":"SaaS","title":"7‑day reset plan for a stuck SaaS","selftext":"\n\nI’m 2 months in, no real progress.

I'm not a \"pro\" at coding nor have I practiced professional coding. I'm just familar with the coding concepts they teach in College and I can read and understand code if I take some time. These are my skills.\n\nMy friend gave the idea to start a b2b agency where we would build ai chatbots, agents and other automations for businesses. Though I didn't have \"great\" coding skills I went with his plan. I saw people create chatbots and all with either no-code platforms or low code ways. So I was like \"sure let's do it\" and with the help of chatgpt, I created my first ai chatbot for a Mexican restaurant I made up.\n\nI used whatsapp as my platform. So a whatsapp ai chatbot. It had like 10 dishes with its ingredients. I tried RAG for the first time. I made a file on notepad and put the menu there. Then with the help of chatgpt, I also created a very simple reservation system for that bot. User tells they want to book, bot asks for name, date, time, number of guests, and when user gives these, a Google calender event is initiated and books the slot for 45min. 15min extra is added as a buffer time for the restaurant to clear up previous diner's table. If slot is already booked the bot could also suggest the next available free slot. All of this was done on python, flask app. I would then run ngrok and then set the callbackurl on twilio. And I would chat with the restaurant bot. This was my first ever ai chatbot I (with chatgpt of course) made.\n\nThen me and my friend started reaching out to local businesses in our area. Most of them weren't interested in the idea. And those who were interested said they didn't want to make a huge investment in it. After a tough month client-searching, we reached out to a perfume shop which was opening near us. They were really interested in this and said they want a whatsapp ai agent for their business which has the entire knowledge of the business and can book reservations for personalized custom perfume creation sessions.\n\nAfter a few meeting they agreed to work with us. Our first client. After a 33% deposit of our original deal, we started their work.\n\nI want advice and suggestions on the work I have done below and tell me if I'm doing it wrong or if I could improve.\n\nUsing python, fastapi, flask, I created the bot. Used ngrok. At first I used twilio to route my messages to whatsapp but during testing and in the meeting with my client, many messages were being silently dropped. I was using the free trial credits. It wasn't because the messages were too long. Simple messages like \"hi how can I help you today\" were also being dropped. So I ditched twilio and then went with Facebook meta for developers. Since I used that, no messages dropped.\n\nAfter having a simple bot functioning, I went ahead and connected the bot to a database. For my backend I used Supabase. Created a table which stores all the numbers, names and birthdays of users interacting with the whatsapp bot. A new table to store messages, incoming message and the reply of the bot.\n\nI also created a user memory table where the bot can store memory of the user, like their preferences, what they like, what they hate, allergies, etc. I also created a seperate column for gifts where if the user says their wife/friend likes/dislikes certain fragrances the bot can smartly store them and bring up in conversations for a personalized experience.\n\nThen I went ahead and created a table for the business' products. Like 30ish in-house perfumes. At this point I didn't think it was a good idea to dump all perfumes of the business into the system prompt, so I created a hash table for all the perfumes fetching from the products table from supabase, its prices, notes, etc. create a cache and then feed it into the system prompt.\n\nNow if the user says they want something refreshing or fresh fragrance, the bot can suggest one or two in-house perfumes that have a fresh feeling/notes in it.\n\nI then created the reservation system. The bot detects intent of the user, if the user wants to book, the bot then asks for date, time and name and then saves into the \"reservation\" table in supabase, creates an event on the business' Google Calendar a 1hr slot, and then the user receives a link to create/add the event into their own Google Calendar along with a thank you message.\n\nI'm a newbie to programming so for me there is sooooo much logic behind just a \"reservation system\". This was where chatgpt couldn't help me but I would give chatgpt these scenarios and then it would give me fixes for my scenarios. (This could also indicate my inexperience in prompting) Like if the user gives invalid date or invalid time, if the slot is taken, if the user asks for availability, if the user already has an upcoming reservation/slot, then they can't book another slot, if they want to reschedule/cancel. All of these scenarios I would tell gpt and then it would help me make those fixes.\n\nAfter making the reservation system, I had another task. The business has in-house perfumes of their own brand and other inspiration perfumes of famously known brands. Now this inspiration perfumes list was huge. Let's say 1000. So I created this table for inspiration perfumes. And with the help of gpt, my bot can now understand the intent of the user and then know right away if the user is talking about an inspiration brand perfume and if so, it can fuzzy match with perfume name directly from the database and then give its prices to the user.\n\nNow all of this was done on vscode and with chatgpt. All debugs, errors and problems I would copy paste from the terminal and then also paste my program to gpt and then ask for fixes. I've seen people talk about ai powered IDEs and I'm not sure if I should use them.

Sitemaps and robots.txt still matter\n\nKeep your sitemap fresh. Remove dead links. Point to it in robots.txt. It’s boring but critical.\n\n4. LLMs.txt is cheap insurance\n\nIt’s an emerging standard. Takes 15 minutes to set up. Drop it in your root, reference it in robots.txt, and update it as your site evolves.\n\n5.

Most of the time, at first, you’ll get ignored, maybe even land in spam.\n\nThe TL;DR is that cold outreach doesn’t magically print meetings. It’s about building trust signals, warming inboxes, and proving you’re worth replying to.\n\nHere’s how it really works (simplified):\n\nYou set up your email infrastructure properly (domains, SPF, DKIM, DMARC).\n\nYou find a list of leads that actually fit your ICP.\n\nYou send them personalized cold emails, not templates blasted to thousands, but messages that feel written just for them.\n\nSome of those leads reply. Some book calls.\n\nNow you know *who* is responding and *why*. That feedback loop is everything. You refine your targeting, sharpen your messaging, and improve your deliverability.\n\nThe more positive signals you create (opens, replies, clicks), the more inbox providers like Google or Microsoft trust you.\n\nAnd the better your cold outreach starts performing.\n\nIt’s not about blasting thousands of emails. It’s about creating consistent signals of quality and trust.\n\n# Audiences &amp; Targeting\n\nWith outreach, you can technically email anyone on the planet. But you *shouldn’t*.\n\nThe power is in narrowing down to your exact ICP. Because unlike ads, you don’t have a machine learning algorithm predicting who’s going to convert. YOU are the algorithm.\n\nThat means you need high-quality data.\n\nExample targets:\n\n* CEOs of SaaS companies with 20–200 employees\n* Marketing directors at D2C brands spending $50k+ on ads\n* HR managers at fast-growing startups hiring remote teams\n\nThe more precise your list, the more likely you’ll get replies.\n\nEvery email you send is like an “impression.” But unlike ads, you can’t just bid higher to get more. If your message is irrelevant or looks like spam, it won’t matter if you send 10 or 10,000, you’ll be ignored (or blacklisted).\n\nThat’s why list quality and targeting matter more than volume.\n\n# The “Auction System” Equivalent\n\nIn ads, you bid against competitors.\n\nIn outreach, your competition is everyone else emailing the same prospect. Their inbox is the “inventory.” And your email is one of dozens fighting for attention that day.\n\nHow do you win? Not with budget, but with **personalization and relevance**.\n\nIf your email feels like it was written for them — referencing their recent post, their company’s growth, their specific pain points — you’ll stand out.\n\nIf it feels like a template, you’ll lose.\n\n# Quality Score in Outreach\n\nJust like ads, outreach has its own version of a Quality Score: **deliverability + engagement.**\n\nIf you send irrelevant or spammy messages, inbox providers lower your sender reputation. Your emails get sent to spam or blocked entirely.\n\nIf you send high-quality, personalized messages that get replies, your reputation goes up.\n\nThat means your emails are cheaper (in terms of effort), and you don’t have to burn through hundreds of leads to get results.\n\nIn simple terms:\n\n* Low quality outreach = spam folder + wasted domains\n* High quality outreach = inbox placement + replies + meetings\n\n# The Formula for Better Outreach\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n**Deliverability (your setup) × Targeting (your list) × Personalization (your message) = Results.**\n\nMess up one, and the whole thing breaks. Nail all three, and you don’t need to spam thousands of people to book consistent calls.\n\ncold outreach isn’t about blasting volume.  \nit’s about building trust, sending the right message, to the right person, at the right time.\n\ndo this right, and you’ll win.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;many people think of cold outreach as a &amp;quot;Send 100 emails, book 10 calls&amp;quot; machine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;sure, that&amp;#39;s YOUR goal, but it’s not how it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are no guaranteed results.

Nothing.\nAnd like any sane person I decided to build it myself.\n\n- I didn’t know how to code at all.\n- I didn’t have funding.\n\n\nStill, after months of trying and failing to teach myself to code...I gave up.\n\nBut a recently we found out we have a baby on the way. And that lit a fire under my ass to learn faster. So I sat down, found a vibecoding platform, and built this site last month.\n\nI got a janky MVP working and launched Vocablii, a tool that turns any YouTube video into a fully interactive vocab learning experience.\n\nIt pulls the transcript from the video\n\nHighlights all the vocabulary in order of frequency\n\nTranslates words on hover\n\nLets you skip words you already know\n\nCreates flashcards with SRS\n\nI even added some mini-games for fun practice because I'm not doing the coding so why not.\n\n\nI thought maybe a few people would find it useful.\nThen I made this Reddit post in r/languagelearning.\n\nAnd straight up overnight I had 150+ users registered users.\nEnglish teachers started reaching out.\n I had to (vibe) rewrite huge parts of the code due to feedback from real learners.\nAnd now I've had to upgrade my API subscriptions due to the traffic. \n\nAll from a single Reddit post that validated the idea.\n\n\nSo...here’s what worked...\n\n1. I built something I actually needed.\nI wasn’t trying to build a business. I was trying to solve my own problem. That made things easy. I literally thought, what would be perfect for ME, and made that. Turns out even though I'm 1-in-a-million that means there's ~8,000 people just like me\n\n2. I told the full story.\nThe job loss, the bilingual household, the new baby - people on the subreddit understood that, they related to it, they reached out and personal messages and gave their support ...I think they wanted me to win because I wasn't some faceless corporation but just some dude on reddit struggling.\n\n3. I stayed in the comments.\nEvery single user issue became a feature. Users told me what was broken, what they loved, and what they wished existed.

Nothing.\nAnd like any sane person I decided to build it myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I didn’t know how to code at all.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I didn’t have funding.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, after months of trying and failing to teach myself to code...I gave up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a recently we found out we have a baby on the way. And that lit a fire under my ass to learn faster. So I sat down, found a vibecoding platform, and built this site last month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a janky MVP working and launched Vocablii, a tool that turns any YouTube video into a fully interactive vocab learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It pulls the transcript from the video&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Highlights all the vocabulary in order of frequency&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Translates words on hover&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lets you skip words you already know&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Creates flashcards with SRS&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even added some mini-games for fun practice because I&amp;#39;m not doing the coding so why not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought maybe a few people would find it useful.\nThen I made this Reddit post in &lt;a href=\"/r/languagelearning\"&gt;r/languagelearning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And straight up overnight I had 150+ users registered users.\nEnglish teachers started reaching out.\n I had to (vibe) rewrite huge parts of the code due to feedback from real learners.\nAnd now I&amp;#39;ve had to upgrade my API subscriptions due to the traffic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All from a single Reddit post that validated the idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So...here’s what worked...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I built something I actually needed.\nI wasn’t trying to build a business. I was trying to solve my own problem. That made things easy. I literally thought, what would be perfect for ME, and made that. Turns out even though I&amp;#39;m 1-in-a-million that means there&amp;#39;s ~8,000 people just like me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I told the full story.\nThe job loss, the bilingual household, the new baby - people on the subreddit understood that, they related to it, they reached out and personal messages and gave their support ...I think they wanted me to win because I wasn&amp;#39;t some faceless corporation but just some dude on reddit struggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stayed in the comments.\nEvery single user issue became a feature. Users told me what was broken, what they loved, and what they wished existed.

If you're scrolling through this sub seeing the 500th AI wrapper, it feels like we're in a race to the bottom.\n\nBut what's actually happening is that you're watching the experimentation phase play out in public. Most of these projects will die, just like most projects have always died. That's not a SaaS problem, that's just how building stuff works.\n\nI'm building [UserJot](https://userjot.com) (user feedback tool) in what everyone would call a \"saturated\" market. There are literally hundreds of feedback tools. By the doom logic, I should be dead already. Instead, we're growing faster than ever because it turns out even crowded markets have gaps if you actually talk to customers.\n\nMost SaaS products are mediocre at best. Even in \"saturated\" markets, 90% of the tools are half-assed, have terrible UX, don't actually solve the core problem, or the founders gave up after 3 months. You don't need to be 10x better. You just need to actually give a damn, stick around, and be 20% better than the crap that's out there. The bar is shockingly low.\n\nBuilding UserJot has given me a window into what other founders are building, and most of you would be shocked.

If you&amp;#39;re scrolling through this sub seeing the 500th AI wrapper, it feels like we&amp;#39;re in a race to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what&amp;#39;s actually happening is that you&amp;#39;re watching the experimentation phase play out in public.

Instead, we&amp;#39;re growing faster than ever because it turns out even crowded markets have gaps if you actually talk to customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most SaaS products are mediocre at best. Even in &amp;quot;saturated&amp;quot; markets, 90% of the tools are half-assed, have terrible UX, don&amp;#39;t actually solve the core problem, or the founders gave up after 3 months. You don&amp;#39;t need to be 10x better. You just need to actually give a damn, stick around, and be 20% better than the crap that&amp;#39;s out there.

Speed and performance\n\nDeepSeek stands out for its fast execution. When a user enters an idea in Promptly, the API instantly generates an enriched, optimized prompt.  \nThe result: a seamless, low-latency experience that keeps users focused on creating, not waiting.\n\n# 🎯 2. Contextual optimization\n\nUnlike basic reformulation tools, DeepSeek offers deep contextual understanding.  \nExample:\n\n* Raw idea: “Logo startup”\n* Generated prompt: “Create a modern, minimalist logo for a tech startup. Style: geometric, colors: blue and white, format: vector.”\n\nThis contextual intelligence makes DeepSeek the perfect engine for structuring prompts according to prompt engineering best practices (role, task, context, format).\n\n# 🧠 3. Versatility and adaptability\n\nThe DeepSeek API covers a wide range of use cases:\n\n* Writing (articles, emails, scripts)\n* Creativity (marketing ideas, brainstorming, social media content)\n* Image generation (optimized prompts for DALL·E &amp; Midjourney)\n\nWith this versatility, Promptly can rely on a single, coherent foundation, without juggling multiple integrations.\n\n# 🔒 4.

I noticed an important pattern:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also realized that tools like &lt;strong&gt;Jungle Scout and Helium 10&lt;/strong&gt; focus &lt;strong&gt;only on the Amazon market&lt;/strong&gt;, leaving many other platforms and opportunities—especially in digital products—untapped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I decided to build a &lt;strong&gt;comprehensive tool&lt;/strong&gt; to help online sellers:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Analyze the market across multiple platforms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Discover profitable products based on real user problems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reduce the risk before investing in any product&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Focus on &lt;strong&gt;high-margin digital products&lt;/strong&gt; as well&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To measure market interest and collect early adopters, I also created a &lt;strong&gt;simple landing page&lt;/strong&gt; where interested users could &lt;strong&gt;sign up with their email&lt;/strong&gt; to get updates and early access.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;🔗 You can check it out here: &lt;a href=\"https://prodsight.tech/\"&gt;https://prodsight.tech/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;🔑 &lt;strong&gt;Lessons I Learned:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don’t rely on intuition alone—use real data.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Products that solve real problems are far more likely to succeed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Trial and error is costly, but &lt;strong&gt;smart tools save time and money&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Existing market tools are good, but often &lt;strong&gt;limited to a single platform&lt;/strong&gt;, so look for broader, more comprehensive solutions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing the idea and collecting interested users&lt;/strong&gt; before launching is critical to reduce risk.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Digital products often &lt;strong&gt;offer higher profit margins&lt;/strong&gt; and lower production costs, making them an excellent opportunity for new sellers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, I share this experience to tell every seller:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"Accomplished-Fix9194","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nl83pa/how_i_lost_2000_before_discovering_the_secret_to/","domain":"self.SaaS","score":0,"num_comments":4,"created_utc":1758298928,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nl7s5p","subreddit":"SaaS","title":"Need your help to build SAAS","selftext":"So I am new in this and I want to make an software/app. Do you know any best YouTube videos of some free courses where I can learn from trash.

If Someone Roasts This, They Probably Don’t Know Marketing.","selftext":"If I had zero dollars for marketing, how would you get your first 1,000 users? I am a relatively early stage SaaS \"wantreprenuer\" because \"founder\" triggers my imposter syndrome. I have only begun developing my product since the start of this year but I have been researching the topics of SaaS and Business Development for 2-3 years prior and have completed courses on entrepreneurship from the Haslam School of Business at the University of Tennessee in recent years. I am no marketing genius and frankly I am writing this as a form of self benefit and to translate some of my skills from declarative to procedural knowledge.\n\nPreface: I initially typed this up in response and to someone asking how they should market to get their first 1,000 customers with a $0 budget. \n\nWith that being said, here's what I would do.\n\n\nStep One: Which many people like to avoid because it makes them feel \"nervous\", call, text or email everyone you know that you have in your contacts, about your product.

Even those who claim to be tech savvy tend to argue with me in saying that the product already exists and what not, but after a 10-15 minute conversation, they understand how it works and go \"great idea, this will make you rich\". Every single person I've spoken to at length has said \"it's a great idea, I've bet you've sold thousands, which retailers will stock you blah blah blah\".\n\nI have also noticed that some of my friends who have said they get it and that it's a great idea, later confess that they still don't get it but they want it.

I've had a handful of professionals reach out to me inquiring about the product and asking if they can recommend it to their clients too.\n\nThat throws text ads out the window, I'm concerned that if I go through all the trouble of making a video ad, people will skip it because the first few minutes do not paint enough of a picture for the person to get it and I can't think of an angle to introduce it as a whole as it has many features that together make it a great device. That will kill my limited budget.\n\nThe main idea I've had so far is to do trade shows or swap meets where I can get the attention of people with candy or with my amazing smile (yeah right), pitch the product to them in different ways, collect data, and then come up with a better advertisement down the track, but I was wondering if anyone here has had this sort of problem and how they overcame it. \n\nI'm working on creating the marketing materials for a 3mX3m tent, but man, if there's anything else I could do other than have to go on the road, please, tell me.

Great idea!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is it takes me a good 2-5 minutes to physically demo the product and showcase all the features for it all to make sense to the buyer. Even then they ask a few follow up questions and I feel that not everything is getting thru. It is a technically complex product that solves a problem that people don&amp;#39;t really know they have, it&amp;#39;s like selling toothpaste to people who brush their teeth with sticks. I&amp;#39;ve had a handful of professionals reach out to me inquiring about the product and asking if they can recommend it to their clients too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That throws text ads out the window, I&amp;#39;m concerned that if I go through all the trouble of making a video ad, people will skip it because the first few minutes do not paint enough of a picture for the person to get it and I can&amp;#39;t think of an angle to introduce it as a whole as it has many features that together make it a great device. That will kill my limited budget.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main idea I&amp;#39;ve had so far is to do trade shows or swap meets where I can get the attention of people with candy or with my amazing smile (yeah right), pitch the product to them in different ways, collect data, and then come up with a better advertisement down the track, but I was wondering if anyone here has had this sort of problem and how they overcame it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m working on creating the marketing materials for a 3mX3m tent, but man, if there&amp;#39;s anything else I could do other than have to go on the road, please, tell me. I have a physical condition that makes it difficult for me to travel but I have to do it to survive but I&amp;#39;m dreeeeeeading the whole thing and seeing it as an ordeal. I&amp;#39;ll be honest in saying that the concept of going on the road has slowed me down a bit and causing anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"____DEADPOOL_______","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nng54o/how_do_you_market_a_product_that_requires_at/","domain":"self.Entrepreneur","score":3,"num_comments":33,"created_utc":1758526572,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnfu4j","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","title":"My startup book and app to validate your business idea","selftext":"Hi everyone!

I sourced the product from China and split the cost with him. His dad gave him the money and I used my own money for my half. We began running ads, but he insisted on having some dude his dad knows run the ads, and he ended up doing an insanely tiny budget over 2 weeks and then not running ads again. We still made 2 sales but anytime I’d ask my friend to have the guy run ads again (meta ads account was in his name) , he’d kind of just avoid it. He had much more free time than me and we’d still talk often but any time I’d bring up the business, he’d just avoid it. After months of nagging him and little interest from his side, I created my own Instagram account for the brand and began running ads in the beginning of September.

We still made 2 sales but anytime I’d ask my friend to have the guy run ads again (meta ads account was in his name) , he’d kind of just avoid it. He had much more free time than me and we’d still talk often but any time I’d bring up the business, he’d just avoid it.

This worked for me for years, but people are getting smarter. With the rise of ai, the growth of social media, and the continuing trend of people hating capitalism, collecting emails is getting harder. At the same time, emails have never been more valuable.\n\nMost people would rather shop with a friend instead of a brand. This post is going to show you how to lead with value, become more personable, and create a real relationship with your customers. \n\n**Have you ever collected emails from a page with no products or collections?**\n\nIf you're answer is no, ask yourself why not?\n\nYou can collect 8-10 times more emails by sending people to a landing page that has nothing for sale. If you're just dropshipping bullshit, this entire post is probably meaningless to you. But, if you plan on building your brand and planning on operating it 5 years from now, this marketing angle could be a game-changer for you.\n\nLet's talk about lead generation landing pages. What you can offer in exchange for an email, how to design the landing pages, and how you can get traffic.   \n  \n**What Makes a Lead Gen Page Convert**\n\nKeep it simple.\n\n* Headline that tells them what they’re getting\n* Subheadline that supports the offer\n* One short form (just email or phone)\n* Clean product or lifestyle visual\n* Social proof (logos, reviews, screenshots)\n* Zero distractions (no nav, no links)\n\nExample headlines:\n\n* Join 10,000+ members in our monthly giveaway.\n* Giveaways. Drops. Secret deals. All for email subscribers only.\n* Get the free \\[ebook title\\] + weekly content that actually helps\n* Join the movement. Tools, tips, and updates before anyone else.\n\nThis works whether you're running Reddit traffic, paid traffic, or pushing them from blog content.\n\n# The Offer: What Do People Get for Submitting Their Email?\n\nDon't overcomplicate this. Just offer something they'd actually want right now.\n\nHere are some of the best lead magnets we've seen work across different brands I've built landing pages for:\n\n* **Giveaways** Great for hyping product drops, collecting UGC, or building waitlists. Example: \"Enter to win our summer bundle. Winner announced next week.\"\n* **Niche Ebooks or Guides** This works when your product needs some education or explanation. Example: If you sell skincare, offer a “7-Day Glow-Up Routine” guide.\n* **Early Access or Waitlists** Works well for limited drops, seasonal restocks, or product launches. Example: \"Be the first to shop our winter collection.\"\n* **VIP Clubs or Secret Stores** Create exclusivity. Example: \"Join our VIP list for early access and members-only offers.\"\n* **Quizzes** Personalized and interactive. Example: “Find your perfect match in 30 seconds.”\n\nWhatever you offer, make it feel instant and valuable.  \nNo need to pitch your brand. Just pitch the reason to sign up.\n\n\n\n# Giveaway Leads\n\n**Goal:** Build curiosity and connection. These leads aren't ready to buy.\n\n**What to send:**\n\n* Giveaway confirmation and what to expect\n* Brand story or founder intro\n* UGC and real reviews\n* Behind-the-scenes or product breakdown\n* A blog post or tip-based email\n\nNo hard pitches. Keep it fun and on-brand. These poeple are greta to re-target back into your community. They may never buy, but they will open your emails, comment on your posts ,and maybe even recommend your brand to a friend. \n\n# Ebook or Guide Leads\n\n**Goal:** Educate first, then position the product as the next step.\n\n**What to send:**\n\n* Ebook delivery with a short intro\n* A tip or insight from the content\n* A story or case study\n* Light CTA with zero pressure\n* New blog posts\n* Relevant products\n\nLet the value do the work. Warm them up without pushing too hard.\n\n# Use Blog Content to Nurture\n\nLink relevant blog content in your flows. These posts help build authority and trust.\n\nExamples:\n\n* 3 ways our customers use this every day\n* Why 60% of buyers come back\n* Tips from the team behind \\[brand name\\]\n\n*This is how you turn a cold signup into a fan who actually wants your emails.*\n\n  \nAfter you run these leads through a nurture flow, you begin to send segmented campaigns that send these warm leads to your main website. \n\n# How to Drive Traffic to Your Lead Gen Pages\n\nYou’ve got the offer. You’ve got the flow. Now you just need people to hit the page.\n\nHere are a few ways to drive **qualified traffic** without needing a product page or paid funnel.\n\n# 1. Reddit (low-cost, high-trust)\n\nThis is the best organic traffic source if you’re willing to play the long game.\n\n* Build a subreddit for your niche, not your brand\n* Post value-driven content 4 to 6 times a week\n* Use Reddit DM tools to message users who mention your niche\n* Pin the lead gen page in your sub once it has momentum\n\nNo hard pitch. Just focus on building a space that feels helpful. The traffic and email signups follow.\n\n# 2. Paid Ads (but not how most people use them)\n\nSend cold traffic to your lead gen page. Not to a product page. Not to a catalog.\n\nJust a single-page offer:\n\n* Giveaway signup\n* Waitlist\n* Niche ebook\n* Free tool or checklist\n\nYour only goal is to collect the email. The backend will convert.\n\nBonus: you’re also building retargeting audiences at the same time. You're going to massively increase the volume of emails you collect that can be used in retargeting campaigns. \n\n# 3. Blog Content + SEO\n\nWrite keyword-targeted blog posts that solve specific problems in your niche.\n\nAt the end of each post, offer something free:\n\n* \"Download the checklist\"\n* \"Grab our free guide\"\n* \"Join the community giveaway\"\n\nYou’ll start collecting emails from people who are already searching for answers. These are some of the warmest leads you can get.\n\n# 4. Organic Social Content\n\nTurn short-form content into mini magnets.\n\nInstagram, TikTok, Facebook Groups, X  all of them work if you lead with value.\n\nDrop soft CTAs:\n\n* \"We’re giving away $250 in gear. Join the list.\"\n* \"Comment 'Hike' for a free ebook that includes the best trails in America and elite hiking tips\"\n* \"Want first dibs on our new release? Join the waitlist.\"\n\nKeep it casual. Push the benefit, not the brand. People who sell info products use these funnels all the time. In fact, basically any MMO guru is using an email funnel that leads to a webinar to sell high-ticket products to warm leads. In the past, ecom store owners never had to go this deep. Today, it's a lot different. But if anyone knows how to extract money out of consumers, it's the influencer grifters. Take note of the high ticket funnels, because that's where mid-high ticket ecom marketing is going. \n\n  \n**Final Thoughts**\n\nMost brands are stuck chasing sales from cold traffic. But there's real power behind the backend marketing. \n\nEvery email you collect is more than just a lead. It’s a retargeting audience, a future buyer, a potential referral, and a compounding asset that works even when your ad account gets shut down. Your email list is the only thing you truly own. If you treat it right, it’ll return value every single month.\n\nThe brands that win long-term are the ones that build trust first. They use real nurture flows, strong content, and segmentation to turn cold leads into warm ones who open, engage, and buy.\n\nA great funnel doesn’t just get someone to buy. It builds a relationship, so they keep coming back. If your backend is right, you won’t need to rely on paid ads forever.\n\nWhile building subreddits for niche ecom brands, I figured out quickly that we can't sell directly on Reddit. Once we got the users off reddit, onto a landing page,  and into our email list, we were able to successfully monetize organic traffic. \n\nThe buyers we get from our landing pages are 5x more likely to buy more than once than the buyers that come from cold traffic (ads or influencers). I'll leave it at that.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most brands rely on popouts and abandoned checkouts to grow their email lists.

Here's what went wrong and went well.","selftext":"Little back story, I work a “9-5”, 4 days a week for 10H as a software developer. I work 4 days to have extra time on Fridays, so I can work on my own products and try to gain MRR, so I can eventually stop working for the “9-5” and focus on my own products and clients.\n\nIt all started with me in the shower on the 11th of September. I had an idea, jumped out of the shower. wrote it down in my notepad and forgot about it a for a bit. The next day I went to the gym and thought about the same idea a bit more and texted some people about the idea(I trust their feedback). Those people gave me the confidence to follow this through.

Well I didn’t want to be the twelfth egg in the dozen, so I had to find another angle. That's when it hit me, A Roast! I am tired of always receiving the same kind of feedback when talking to AI. So what if I turn my requested feedback about my website in a roast? In that way I get feedback and a laugh (hopefully).\n\n12th of September \\~10pm I started with the help of my good friend Claude planning the project requirements. What stack I’d be using, what AI tools I would integrate for the roasting of the websites. After a short planning session I started setting up the architecture and went to bed.\n\nBecause I thought this would be a fast project I started with Supabase as my supplier for authentication and database. Stripe as my payment platform because I am familiar with it.\n\nThe first few days went smooth and on a Monday 15 September I thought I was on a roll and I would be able to release this thing on a Thursday 6PM the 140H mark. So I announced it on X. I even started teasing the logo AI generated. I couldn’t have been more wrong.\n\nThe Roasts were working, I was able to roast my own website with different agents, but the roasts were very predictable. The ability to actually listen to roasts was a good thing. I had a lot of laughs during testing. I started working on the AI agent feedback system. That went smooth as well. The next Wednesday (17 Sept.), I was certain I was going to make the release. So I purchased the Domain and added it to my Vercel project. I started preparing for launch. Only doing small tweaks. But then I had the brilliant Idea to make the payment system a little bit more dynamic and scalable for the future by fetching available payment options. This is where my week turned into a nightmare.\n\nOut of nowhere, my payment system wasn’t working anymore. The form wasn’t loading anymore. My Opera browser started seeing my Stripe form as an advertisement. So after debugging for 2-3 hours I decided to test it in Chrome, same issues. Firefox, same issues. I was very tired so I wasn’t really using my brain. I forgot to properly work with version control. Prior to my last commit I already made some changes to the payment logic. And because I started to really rely on Claude I lost control of it.\n\nShit, I didn’t know what to do, I even opened PHPStorm and started digging through my Local history on PHPStorm, to no result, because I don’t really use it for front-end projects. Instead of making a back-up and being really tired and not thinking straight I made the decision to store the current state of the code to a new branch and start over with the improvements I made before messing with the payment system. That went smooth, because I coded it once before so I kinda knew it. After a long stressful annoying night, I went to bed at \\~2AM, satisfied.\n\nThe next morning after a short night of sleep, It was Thursday, the day of the “announced” release. I was very tired. Around 1PM I decided to call it quits for the 9-5 and make up the time next week. I needed to deploy Pagerekt to Vercel. I was making some last minute changes on my personal PC to Pagerekt and was ready to deploy. I needed to restart my local dev server a couple of times. But my personal PC is Windows and for the life of me my local dev server wouldn’t shut down properly.\n\nI decided to grab my Macbook, which I normally don’t use for personal projects and started working from there. First I had to quickly get that up and running. Finally I had all the control I needed over my project. I deployed my project in the hope that I could properly test it before the launch at 6PM. Vercel hit me with the fact that my personal version control account is different than the one from my 9-5. So I had to convert my free account in to a “team” account and had to pay $20/month for the “team” subscription and another $20/month for an extra “seat”. Oh I so didn’t care, I just wanted my project live and working.\n\nFinally the project was deployed and I could start the testing. Then the real problems started to occur. My firebase authentication wasn’t working properly. When I was able to log in, and tried to generate a free roast, the roast timed out. After researching that was an easy fix. But the authentication seemed to be a consistent problem. I focussed heavily on the buggy authentication. It was 6PM, I still wasn’t able to have a stable session.\n\nShit I missed my launch. That’s okay, no reason to give up now. The entire night I spend rebuilding the authentication from Supabase to NextJS Auth. (Best decision I’ve made, this entire project). At 3AM with the authentication being stable, but not being able to create roasts, I went to bed.\n\nThe Friday morning I woke up on the late side of my normal schedule. I grabbed breakfast and went straight to my computer. I fixed the issues that were causing users not being able to create roasts. Then I became lazy and I told Claude to remove my debugging code. He started working on it. After a bit he suggested using a script to remove every debug line. With my still sleepy head I read the script, it looked good, It wasn’t. All of a sudden 1800 errors appeared in my code. Frick, what just happened? Claude also thought it was a good idea to try and solve it. Now there were \\~2500 errors. My blood was cooking, to calm down, I went to the gym. During my gym session I realized I didn’t commit my fixed issues (again). I was furious, the same mistake in less than a week?\n\nBehind my MacBook again after the gym session I tried to fix all \\~2500 errors by hand. After 30 minutes I barely made a dent in the list of errors. There was no way I was going to fix all \\~2500 errors by hand. I had to resort to resetting to my last commit and losing all of my progress again.\n\nNow with a clear goal in mind I started fixing all of the bugs that stopped users from being able to make roasts. Committing every little fix that I did. I made some improvements. I launched it and did some live testing to make sure roasts where being able to be made, payments went through etc. After calling it a day, my partner told me I looked tired. So I went to the bathroom and checked my self in the mirror. Yes I looked very tired, in my mind I just fought a war.\n\nSo after \\~20 hours of being live with my latest product Pagerekt , I had the time to reflect what happened last 160H. My learning are: It’s okay to commit yourself to a deadline, but keep it healthy. This grind wasn’t healthy. I need to use version control better, after 30-60 minutes of work when I take a break, commit your work. While I am tired I tend to make mistakes that I normally don’t make. Take more breaks. It is okay if your deadline you set for yourself isn’t met, the world isn’t going to end. Working with AI API’s is easier than I originally thought. I can do a lot in a really short time. It is fun to challenge myself.\n\nThis was my story about my 160H rodeo, resulting in Pagerekt a landing page/product roasting tool that gives you feedback but also gives you a good laugh about your own landing page and product.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little back story, I work a “9-5”, 4 days a week for 10H as a software developer.

I stayed in the comments.\nEvery single user issue became a feature. Users told me what was broken, what they loved, and what they wished existed.

Since then I have accumulated \\~$2.9m in net worth via assets (excl. my house and excl. actual business value).\n\nMy business is cyclical and niche, and its very \"key man\", so I don't assign any actual value to the business. Over the last 4 years my industry grew, I made a lot of money, it was very fun, but my industry in 2025 is very slow and I am feeling the impact of hordes of new competition, the recession, and a structurally low growth economy. Business is pitifully slow, and no matter how much actual work I put in, it's not changing my ability to grow. The only path to growth is via risks (ie debt) that I'm not comfortable with. I have made it this far taking almost no risk, and I do not want to go back to 0.\n\n2021-2023 were big, then I made \\~$400k net last year, $500k this year, and I figure I'll make $200k next year if things don't improve. The last 2 years I have worked so hard and without a few random large wins, I would have made $150k max each year.\n\nI have seen what running a business with tailwinds does, and there is nothing like it. It's fun, you can be creative and use all of your talents to the max, you're on top of the world and life is just exhilarating. If I could spend the next 10 years in 2023, I would be worth $100m by 2035 no question. Even without the money, I was so happy because I felt I was using all of my abilities I've worked for so long to develop. I need that back in my life again.\n\n**So here's why I'm posting to** r/Entrepreneur **:** if I continue on this path, even with low growth, I can almost certainly hit $10m by the time I hit 40 yo. The knowledge, experience, relationships, and of course my assets, will continue to compound over the next decade and I will have a little empire.\n\nBut every day I am suffering from anxiety and just so much stress that I'm not doing enough. I tasted what thriving feels like and everything else is dull. More than anything I want to feel like I can express my creativity, grow, and profit... for people who aren't in the business world it's hard to understand, but if you've been there you know how it feels. Growth is life. And not being in that state, it tears you apart.\n\nI have a great wife, family, home, friends, hobbies. No problems there. But I can't retire, I have too much energy and I want that feeling back. But I have no idea where to find it, which is just compounding my anxiety.\n\nAnd I have always used this pent up anxiety and dread at not doing enough as fuel, it has always pushed me, but right now it has nowhere to go and is overflowing and burning a hole in me.\n\nI've spent months looking into new businesses that are adjacent to mine, they're all slowing down too because of the recession / growth issues. And unless I buy a business, ie take on debt, they're very key man driven. I've decided that any \"small business\" that is adjacent to mine would be a downgrade from what I do for a variety of reasons, because I can't directly compound, and if it's going to be a slow growth slog, I might as well continue doing what I am doing because it doesn't require nearly as much work at my stage.\n\n**My question:**\n\nFor those of you who have had early career success and encountered a recession / major slowdown, what did you do? How did you pivot, how did you decide how to dedicate time to an existing business that \"works but isn't thriving\" vs new ventures?\n\nIf you have been in my shoes, have had this painful anxiety that was once helpful, did you continue to use it as fuel? Is this how everyone who craves success just feels?","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started a business in 2021 with ~50k to my name.

I need that back in my life again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So here&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m posting to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"/r/Entrepreneur\"&gt;r/Entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; if I continue on this path, even with low growth, I can almost certainly hit $10m by the time I hit 40 yo. The knowledge, experience, relationships, and of course my assets, will continue to compound over the next decade and I will have a little empire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But every day I am suffering from anxiety and just so much stress that I&amp;#39;m not doing enough. I tasted what thriving feels like and everything else is dull. More than anything I want to feel like I can express my creativity, grow, and profit... for people who aren&amp;#39;t in the business world it&amp;#39;s hard to understand, but if you&amp;#39;ve been there you know how it feels. Growth is life. And not being in that state, it tears you apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a great wife, family, home, friends, hobbies. No problems there. But I can&amp;#39;t retire, I have too much energy and I want that feeling back. But I have no idea where to find it, which is just compounding my anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I have always used this pent up anxiety and dread at not doing enough as fuel, it has always pushed me, but right now it has nowhere to go and is overflowing and burning a hole in me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve spent months looking into new businesses that are adjacent to mine, they&amp;#39;re all slowing down too because of the recession / growth issues. And unless I buy a business, ie take on debt, they&amp;#39;re very key man driven. I&amp;#39;ve decided that any &amp;quot;small business&amp;quot; that is adjacent to mine would be a downgrade from what I do for a variety of reasons, because I can&amp;#39;t directly compound, and if it&amp;#39;s going to be a slow growth slog, I might as well continue doing what I am doing because it doesn&amp;#39;t require nearly as much work at my stage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My question:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have had early career success and encountered a recession / major slowdown, what did you do? How did you pivot, how did you decide how to dedicate time to an existing business that &amp;quot;works but isn&amp;#39;t thriving&amp;quot; vs new ventures?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have been in my shoes, have had this painful anxiety that was once helpful, did you continue to use it as fuel? Is this how everyone who craves success just feels?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"Erniethetoad","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nle2b5/29_yo_29m_nw_i_need_help_i_am_dying_of_anxiety/","domain":"self.Entrepreneur","score":0,"num_comments":5,"created_utc":1758312574,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nldxgd","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","title":"If you had an unlimited budget for ads, where would you spend it when launching your business?","selftext":"Hi everyone!

The problem is that most jump straight into buying tools without knowing which processes  should be automated or where AI will actually save time versus just add complexity, or what the hidden costs and risks are. That’s where an AI audit or consultation comes in. Just think of this like a business health check before making a big investment,And here’s why it’s worth doing first: Not all tasks should be automated; some processes, like high-touch sales, are better handled by people, while others, like qualifying leads, scheduling, or FAQ handling, are perfect for AI. Without a proper review, you risk wasting money automating the wrong things. An audit helps  you get a clear ROI roadmap, showing where AI will save hours per week, which tasks will cut costs, and how long it’ll take to see ROI, turning AI hype into real business outcomes. Finally, it reduces mistakes, integrating AI without a plan often leads to missed leads from bad workflows, customer frustration from chatbots that don’t answer properly, or compliance/security risks from handling sensitive data wrong; an audit prevents these headaches. the bottom line is that  an AI audit/consultation helps small business owners figure out where AI makes sense and where it doesn’t.

If you serve customers locally, this is probably more important than trying to rank nationally.\n\nLocal SEO works differently than regular SEO. Instead of competing with every business worldwide, you're mainly competing with other businesses in your city or region. Google prioritizes location when showing search results for local services.\n\nYour Google Business Profile is the most important piece. This is the listing that shows up in Google Maps and local search results. It displays your address, hours, phone number, photos, and customer reviews. Keeping this information accurate and updated directly affects your local search visibility.\n\nCustomer reviews play a major role in local rankings. Businesses with more positive reviews typically rank higher than those with fewer reviews. Responding to reviews, both positive and negative, also signals to Google that you're actively managing your online presence.\n\nYour website needs location-specific information to rank locally. Include your city and service area in your page content naturally. Create separate pages for different locations if you serve multiple areas. Don't stuff keywords unnaturally, but make sure your location is clear.\n\nConsistency across online directories matters. Your business name, address, and phone number should match exactly across Google, Yelp, Facebook, industry directories, and your website. Inconsistent information confuses search engines and can hurt your rankings.\n\nLocal keywords work differently than broad keywords. People search for \"plumber near me\" or \"pizza downtown\" rather than just \"plumber\" or \"pizza.\" Include location-based terms in your website content and page titles where relevant.\n\nBuilding local citations helps establish credibility. Citations are mentions of your business name, address, and phone number on other websites like directories, local business associations, or community websites. Quality matters more than quantity.\n\nMobile optimization is crucial for local SEO since most local searches happen on phones. Your website must load quickly and work well on mobile devices. Google uses mobile performance as a ranking factor.\n\nLocal SEO takes time to show results. Changes to your Google Business Profile might appear within days, but improvements to website rankings typically take weeks or months. Consistency and patience are important for long-term success.\n\nAnyone seeing good results from local SEO efforts, or struggling with specific aspects of local search optimization?","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local SEO helps your business show up when people in your area search for what you offer.

I wanted to share a quick case study / how-to from my recent project. I had a client with a cool product (a home workout kit) but their Amazon listing was…underwhelming. Very generic copy. We did a makeover focusing on some classic copywriting principles, and sales jumped ~35% the following week.\n\n🤯\nHere’s what we changed:\n\n1. Lead with an emotional benefit: The original copy started with product specs. I replaced that first line with a benefit-driven statement: “Achieve gym-quality results at home – feel the burn, minus the commute.” – Immediately tells the customer what’s in it for them (convenience + results).\n\n2. Sprinkle in sensory and power words: We added words like “sculpt”, “exclusive program”, “effortless 15-minute routines” to make it more vivid and appealing. Language that evokes feeling &gt; dry facts.\n\n3. Added social proof: Worked in a one-liner testimonial from a beta user: “Surpassed my expectations – my go-to daily workout now.” This builds trust.\n\n4. Clear CTA: The original description kind of just… ended. We added a gentle nudge: “Ready to transform? Get your kit today and start your journey!” – sometimes people need to be told to take action.\n\n5.

Have you seen similar results from copy changes?","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Happy Friday, marketers! I wanted to share a quick case study / how-to from my recent project. I had a client with a cool product (a home workout kit) but their Amazon listing was…underwhelming. Very generic copy. We did a makeover focusing on some classic copywriting principles, and sales jumped ~35% the following week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;🤯\nHere’s what we changed:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead with an emotional benefit: The original copy started with product specs. I replaced that first line with a benefit-driven statement: “Achieve gym-quality results at home – feel the burn, minus the commute.” – Immediately tells the customer what’s in it for them (convenience + results).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprinkle in sensory and power words: We added words like “sculpt”, “exclusive program”, “effortless 15-minute routines” to make it more vivid and appealing. Language that evokes feeling &amp;gt; dry facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added social proof: Worked in a one-liner testimonial from a beta user: “Surpassed my expectations – my go-to daily workout now.” This builds trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clear CTA: The original description kind of just… ended. We added a gentle nudge: “Ready to transform? Get your kit today and start your journey!” – sometimes people need to be told to take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Format for readability: Broke a long wall of text into bullet points highlighting key benefits (fast setup, all-in-one kit, etc.).

Just because two repetitions or code look the same does not mean they are the same. DRY is more often than not misapplied. DRY is about having a consistent source of truth for business logic more than anything. It’s about centralizing knowledge, not eliminating repetition. Every time you write reusable code, you’re creating a coupling point between parts of the system. You should be careful in doing so.\n\nThere is a real cost to premature abstraction. Say you have two buttons that both use bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded. A DRY purist would immediately extract this into a .btn-primary class or component. But what happens when the designer asks you to make one button slightly larger, or change the color of just one? Now you’re either breaking the abstraction or creating .btn-primary-large variants. You’ve traded simple, explicit code for a brittle abstraction.\n\nThe same thing happens with JavaScript. You see two functions that share a few lines and immediately extract a utility. But when requirements change, you end up with utility functions that take a dozen parameters or do completely different things based on flags. The cure becomes worse than the disease.\n\nCoupling is the real enemy. Every time you create a reusable piece of code, you’re saying “these things will always change together.” But how often is that actually true? When you abstract too early, you’re making a bet that two separate parts of your system will evolve in lockstep. Most of the time, you lose that bet.\nThis coupling makes refactoring a nightmare. Want to change how one part works? First you need to understand how it affects every other part that shares the abstraction. Want to delete a feature? Good luck untangling it from the shared utilities it depends on.\n\nThe obsession with eliminating visual repetition often leads to premature abstraction. Sometimes repetition is actually good. It makes code more explicit, easier to understand, and prevents tight coupling between unrelated parts of your system. \n\nWhen people complain that Tailwind violates DRY, they’re missing the point entirely. CSS classes aren’t business logic. Having flex items-center in multiple places isn’t violating DRY any more than using the same variable name in different functions.\n\nWhen does DRY actually matter?

Start with repetition. Make it work first, then identify patterns that actually represent shared knowledge.

So my time online working is pretty aloof, even though I do get my 6 to 8 hours per day in.\n\nThe other night I was in the middle of a task for a client. It carried over into the next day, and I also had plans for that night. So around 6pm I headed off. Client had clear indication that what was being done would take a couple days, and that I'd update them when it was done, or if I ran into any issues.\n\n*Yet apparently expected an update before I went offline,* of exactly where I was, and exactly what it'd take ... even though... again...they knew that it wasn't supposed to be done by that night. I also have **never** established an expectation (scope or contract) that includes nightly updates during active tasks.\n\n**So what did they do?**  \nWaited until about 10:30PM, and then called me back-to-back-to-back until I picked up, demanding an updated, and explaining to me how much of a problem it was that I hadn't given them an update.\n\n**Here's the rub: If someone wants that level of communication, then they can pay a monthly/weekly retainer because then I actually work for them in that capacity...not one-off odd-job-level tasks that one expects an itemized invoice for.**\n\nI told them I'd do better about trying to check in -- and I genuinely meant that. I will likely end up checking in each time because it's minimal effort, and then sent them an email outlining what my general day-to-day could loosely expected to be, and gently nudged the fact that there will be some times that I am simply away and they need to be okay with that and not spam me just because I didn't check in.\n\nThey came back with that being *\"too much information\"* and that they simply need to know when they can **expect** me to reply, and tried to outline \"if I email you and don't get a reply within an hour, can I call\", etc. etc.\n\n# SO the final-effin-end of it:\n\n**With that context in mind how do I tell them the polite professional version of (I'm going to word it bluntly here...please be gentle, as I'm just saying it unironically to be clear):**\n\n\"Apologies for the TMI aspect of my previous email, but I was trying to tell you politely that while I understand you were frustrated the other night about no update, I will try my best to update you before going offline from now on. Not because you're entitled to it, but because it's a minimal-enough request that I can surely fit in a 5 minute email. But you need to understand that while I'm willing to do that, I am under absolutely no obligation to do it, unless we have a contract signed saying that I will do that, **and** unless you're paying me enough to warrant doing that...which  is usually for people charging $250 to $1000 or more per month on retainer regardless of hours spent working.   \n  \nAt that point, you and I are invested enough that you have some leash in dictating communication &amp; schedule.

So my time online working is pretty aloof, even though I do get my 6 to 8 hours per day in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other night I was in the middle of a task for a client. It carried over into the next day, and I also had plans for that night. So around 6pm I headed off. Client had clear indication that what was being done would take a couple days, and that I&amp;#39;d update them when it was done, or if I ran into any issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yet apparently expected an update before I went offline,&lt;/em&gt; of exactly where I was, and exactly what it&amp;#39;d take ... even though... again...they knew that it wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to be done by that night. I also have &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; established an expectation (scope or contract) that includes nightly updates during active tasks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what did they do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nWaited until about 10:30PM, and then called me back-to-back-to-back until I picked up, demanding an updated, and explaining to me how much of a problem it was that I hadn&amp;#39;t given them an update.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the rub: If someone wants that level of communication, then they can pay a monthly/weekly retainer because then I actually work for them in that capacity...not one-off odd-job-level tasks that one expects an itemized invoice for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told them I&amp;#39;d do better about trying to check in -- and I genuinely meant that. I will likely end up checking in each time because it&amp;#39;s minimal effort, and then sent them an email outlining what my general day-to-day could loosely expected to be, and gently nudged the fact that there will be some times that I am simply away and they need to be okay with that and not spam me just because I didn&amp;#39;t check in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They came back with that being &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;too much information&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; and that they simply need to know when they can &lt;strong&gt;expect&lt;/strong&gt; me to reply, and tried to outline &amp;quot;if I email you and don&amp;#39;t get a reply within an hour, can I call&amp;quot;, etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;SO the final-effin-end of it:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With that context in mind how do I tell them the polite professional version of (I&amp;#39;m going to word it bluntly here...please be gentle, as I&amp;#39;m just saying it unironically to be clear):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Apologies for the TMI aspect of my previous email, but I was trying to tell you politely that while I understand you were frustrated the other night about no update, I will try my best to update you before going offline from now on. Not because you&amp;#39;re entitled to it, but because it&amp;#39;s a minimal-enough request that I can surely fit in a 5 minute email. But you need to understand that while I&amp;#39;m willing to do that, I am under absolutely no obligation to do it, unless we have a contract signed saying that I will do that, &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; unless you&amp;#39;re paying me enough to warrant doing that...which  is usually for people charging $250 to $1000 or more per month on retainer regardless of hours spent working.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point, you and I are invested enough that you have some leash in dictating communication &amp;amp; schedule.

So you loose that token id.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tempted to wrap `t()` with my own function that appends a hidden `span` with a i18n-id data attribute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t be the only one whose encountered this?

That's why I built [LabelMob.com](https://labelmob.com/) – a platform designed to match companies, universities, and research teams with expert annotators who have real expertise in fields like physics, chemistry, math, biology, data science, and more. How It Works:\n\n* For Hirers (Companies/Universities): Post your annotation projects and specify the expertise needed. We connect you with vetted individuals or specialized annotation companies who can handle niche tasks accurately and efficiently. Think: annotating MRI scans by medical physicists or labeling molecular data by chemists.\n* For Annotators (Experts/Companies): Sign up to showcase your skills and get matched with paid gigs that align with your background. It's a great way for domain experts to monetize their knowledge on a flexible basis.\n\nThe goal is to improve dataset quality for ML models – we all know garbage in, garbage out, right? Better annotations mean better training data, leading to more reliable AI systems in research and industry.\n\n**Why Now?**\n\nWith the explosion of multimodal and specialized ML applications (e.g., drug discovery, climate modeling, autonomous systems), the demand for expert-level labeling is skyrocketing.

Everything I built was bootstrapped.\n\nIn 2010, I started a consulting firm called Weavora with two partners.\n\nI took sales calls from my car on lunch breaks, then worked nights in our tiny office with ragged curtains and cheap desks.\n\nMy first big challenge was finding clients on Odesk. Back then, even a brand-new profile could win jobs if you wrote thoughtful replies. We found an approach that worked and kept using it. That’s how we landed our first clients.\n\nOutsourcing grew quick. That is probably the fastest way to get started. But the dark side showed up too: endless deadlines, unrealistic demands, and brilliant work thrown in the trash.\n\nWe even worked with a big public company on an important project. Success, right?\n\nBut we didn’t feel like we were doing what we loved. We didn’t want to follow the typical outsourcing path, growing wide, hiring and training people, only to watch them leave. We wanted to stay a small team. My idols at that time were Teehan+Lax\n\nBy 2014, we wanted to try something different. Everyone around us was chasing products, not projects.\n\nWe tested a few ideas. Only one stuck: Everhour.\n\nAt first it was just a side project. By 2016, we shut down consulting and went all-in.\n\nGrowth came naturally through SEO, integrations, and content. Back then, project management tools didn’t have built-in time tracking. We filled that gap.\n\nIt worked. Within a few years Everhour hit $1M ARR with no outside funding. Today it’s multiple times bigger.\n\nBut many advantages slowly faded and we decided to start something new in parallel. We thought that growing another product from 0 to $1M ARR felt more realistic than trying to add the same amount on top of an older, slower-growing one.\n\nWell, it is tough. Starting a new company feels harder and slower than supporting an existing one. It’s tough when expectations don’t match reality.\n\nBootstrapping isn’t sexy. And I can’t say it’s the right path for everyone.\n\nBootstrapping means living on revenue, always keeping a buffer, always staying disciplined. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. And it pulls you in.\n\nOne unwritten rule we set for ourselves and never broke was this: never quit a job or shut down a business until the next one could at least cover basic salaries. That rule gave us resilience.\n\nNow, at almost 40, I’m slowly learning something else, that balance matters more than the race. Sleep debt and stress always come due.\n\nLiving in Cyprus with my family, with the sea and nature around me, I see that building companies is also about building a life.\n\nThe biggest lessons? \n\nFirst - everything has its time and when people talk about their success, they often underestimate the role of luck. A lot of it comes down to being in the right place at the right time.\n\nSecond - don’t just chase opportunity. We kept starting new things to stay alive, curious, and energized. Losing money hurts.

Today it’s multiple times bigger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But many advantages slowly faded and we decided to start something new in parallel. We thought that growing another product from 0 to $1M ARR felt more realistic than trying to add the same amount on top of an older, slower-growing one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, it is tough. Starting a new company feels harder and slower than supporting an existing one. It’s tough when expectations don’t match reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bootstrapping isn’t sexy. And I can’t say it’s the right path for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bootstrapping means living on revenue, always keeping a buffer, always staying disciplined. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. And it pulls you in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One unwritten rule we set for ourselves and never broke was this: never quit a job or shut down a business until the next one could at least cover basic salaries. That rule gave us resilience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, at almost 40, I’m slowly learning something else, that balance matters more than the race. Sleep debt and stress always come due.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Living in Cyprus with my family, with the sea and nature around me, I see that building companies is also about building a life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest lessons? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First - everything has its time and when people talk about their success, they often underestimate the role of luck. A lot of it comes down to being in the right place at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second - don’t just chase opportunity. We kept starting new things to stay alive, curious, and energized. Losing money hurts. But losing meaning hurts more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"evermike","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1nnksuk/from_car_calls_to_1m_arr_product_my_bootstrapped/","domain":"self.startups","score":0,"num_comments":2,"created_utc":1758543256,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnh5e9","subreddit":"startups","title":"Legal aspects for MVP [I will not promote]","selftext":"I am trying to follow the \"start-up\" playbook by developing and launching my MVP as quickly as possible.

No way we keep paying 80€/month again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that said, we decided to redesign the entire thing from scratch through HTML. For domain, we&amp;#39;ll probably migrate to Hostinger and for hosting, GitHub Pages seems to be a good option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard about how website redesign could affect SEO, how bad things could go? Will our PageRank drop significantly with the domain/host transfer &amp;amp; redesign? I&amp;#39;ve used tools like PageSpeed Insights and my redesign has a better score, but I wanted to hear your opinions/tips about it. I am aware this is probably the worst-case scenario when it comes to SEO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The good news is that we have good reviews on Google Maps (4,5/5 stars for ~300 reviews) and the PageRank seems to be good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Technical info:\nThe live website = almost static website (use of .php, only for animated images): home page, 3 pages, and form page. We have on average 2000 views per month.
