I needed tool that can read my code and help me explain technical decisions in language clients actually understand. When showing database design, it helps me explain how the structure supports scalability and performance. When reviewing API architecture, it translates technical benefits into business value propositions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The change in client relationships has been dramatic.

Is it just better to use the domain with my legal name or does it not matter at all?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One consideration is invoices, I imagine I have to put my full legal name on them always.. so it&amp;#39;s kinda weird if I have a Pseudonym, but then when clients get my invoice it has my actual legal name on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also if I were to go with the business name.. is that a bad idea legally? it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m posing as a business while not actually being one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"neetbuck","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nn0dhl/freelancing_and_naming_question/","domain":"self.webdev","score":0,"num_comments":1,"created_utc":1758481082,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nmzhdv","subreddit":"webdev","title":"Help me choose between MSI MAG 274QRF-QD E2 vs G274QRFW","selftext":"I want a 27\" QHD IPS monitor mainly for programming, maybe some gaming later.

Just because two repetitions or code look the same does not mean they are the same. DRY is more often than not misapplied. DRY is about having a consistent source of truth for business logic more than anything. It’s about centralizing knowledge, not eliminating repetition. Every time you write reusable code, you’re creating a coupling point between parts of the system. You should be careful in doing so.\n\nThere is a real cost to premature abstraction. Say you have two buttons that both use bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded. A DRY purist would immediately extract this into a .btn-primary class or component. But what happens when the designer asks you to make one button slightly larger, or change the color of just one? Now you’re either breaking the abstraction or creating .btn-primary-large variants. You’ve traded simple, explicit code for a brittle abstraction.\n\nThe same thing happens with JavaScript. You see two functions that share a few lines and immediately extract a utility. But when requirements change, you end up with utility functions that take a dozen parameters or do completely different things based on flags. The cure becomes worse than the disease.\n\nCoupling is the real enemy. Every time you create a reusable piece of code, you’re saying “these things will always change together.” But how often is that actually true? When you abstract too early, you’re making a bet that two separate parts of your system will evolve in lockstep. Most of the time, you lose that bet.\nThis coupling makes refactoring a nightmare. Want to change how one part works? First you need to understand how it affects every other part that shares the abstraction. Want to delete a feature? Good luck untangling it from the shared utilities it depends on.\n\nThe obsession with eliminating visual repetition often leads to premature abstraction. Sometimes repetition is actually good. It makes code more explicit, easier to understand, and prevents tight coupling between unrelated parts of your system. \n\nWhen people complain that Tailwind violates DRY, they’re missing the point entirely. CSS classes aren’t business logic. Having flex items-center in multiple places isn’t violating DRY any more than using the same variable name in different functions.\n\nWhen does DRY actually matter?

Start with repetition. Make it work first, then identify patterns that actually represent shared knowledge.

So my time online working is pretty aloof, even though I do get my 6 to 8 hours per day in.\n\nThe other night I was in the middle of a task for a client. It carried over into the next day, and I also had plans for that night. So around 6pm I headed off. Client had clear indication that what was being done would take a couple days, and that I'd update them when it was done, or if I ran into any issues.\n\n*Yet apparently expected an update before I went offline,* of exactly where I was, and exactly what it'd take ... even though... again...they knew that it wasn't supposed to be done by that night. I also have **never** established an expectation (scope or contract) that includes nightly updates during active tasks.\n\n**So what did they do?**  \nWaited until about 10:30PM, and then called me back-to-back-to-back until I picked up, demanding an updated, and explaining to me how much of a problem it was that I hadn't given them an update.\n\n**Here's the rub: If someone wants that level of communication, then they can pay a monthly/weekly retainer because then I actually work for them in that capacity...not one-off odd-job-level tasks that one expects an itemized invoice for.**\n\nI told them I'd do better about trying to check in -- and I genuinely meant that. I will likely end up checking in each time because it's minimal effort, and then sent them an email outlining what my general day-to-day could loosely expected to be, and gently nudged the fact that there will be some times that I am simply away and they need to be okay with that and not spam me just because I didn't check in.\n\nThey came back with that being *\"too much information\"* and that they simply need to know when they can **expect** me to reply, and tried to outline \"if I email you and don't get a reply within an hour, can I call\", etc. etc.\n\n# SO the final-effin-end of it:\n\n**With that context in mind how do I tell them the polite professional version of (I'm going to word it bluntly here...please be gentle, as I'm just saying it unironically to be clear):**\n\n\"Apologies for the TMI aspect of my previous email, but I was trying to tell you politely that while I understand you were frustrated the other night about no update, I will try my best to update you before going offline from now on. Not because you're entitled to it, but because it's a minimal-enough request that I can surely fit in a 5 minute email. But you need to understand that while I'm willing to do that, I am under absolutely no obligation to do it, unless we have a contract signed saying that I will do that, **and** unless you're paying me enough to warrant doing that...which  is usually for people charging $250 to $1000 or more per month on retainer regardless of hours spent working.   \n  \nAt that point, you and I are invested enough that you have some leash in dictating communication &amp; schedule.

So my time online working is pretty aloof, even though I do get my 6 to 8 hours per day in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other night I was in the middle of a task for a client. It carried over into the next day, and I also had plans for that night. So around 6pm I headed off. Client had clear indication that what was being done would take a couple days, and that I&amp;#39;d update them when it was done, or if I ran into any issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yet apparently expected an update before I went offline,&lt;/em&gt; of exactly where I was, and exactly what it&amp;#39;d take ... even though... again...they knew that it wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to be done by that night. I also have &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; established an expectation (scope or contract) that includes nightly updates during active tasks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what did they do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nWaited until about 10:30PM, and then called me back-to-back-to-back until I picked up, demanding an updated, and explaining to me how much of a problem it was that I hadn&amp;#39;t given them an update.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the rub: If someone wants that level of communication, then they can pay a monthly/weekly retainer because then I actually work for them in that capacity...not one-off odd-job-level tasks that one expects an itemized invoice for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told them I&amp;#39;d do better about trying to check in -- and I genuinely meant that. I will likely end up checking in each time because it&amp;#39;s minimal effort, and then sent them an email outlining what my general day-to-day could loosely expected to be, and gently nudged the fact that there will be some times that I am simply away and they need to be okay with that and not spam me just because I didn&amp;#39;t check in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They came back with that being &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;too much information&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; and that they simply need to know when they can &lt;strong&gt;expect&lt;/strong&gt; me to reply, and tried to outline &amp;quot;if I email you and don&amp;#39;t get a reply within an hour, can I call&amp;quot;, etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;SO the final-effin-end of it:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With that context in mind how do I tell them the polite professional version of (I&amp;#39;m going to word it bluntly here...please be gentle, as I&amp;#39;m just saying it unironically to be clear):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Apologies for the TMI aspect of my previous email, but I was trying to tell you politely that while I understand you were frustrated the other night about no update, I will try my best to update you before going offline from now on. Not because you&amp;#39;re entitled to it, but because it&amp;#39;s a minimal-enough request that I can surely fit in a 5 minute email. But you need to understand that while I&amp;#39;m willing to do that, I am under absolutely no obligation to do it, unless we have a contract signed saying that I will do that, &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; unless you&amp;#39;re paying me enough to warrant doing that...which  is usually for people charging $250 to $1000 or more per month on retainer regardless of hours spent working.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point, you and I are invested enough that you have some leash in dictating communication &amp;amp; schedule.
