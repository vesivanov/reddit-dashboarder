The problem is that most jump straight into buying tools without knowing which processes  should be automated or where AI will actually save time versus just add complexity, or what the hidden costs and risks are. That’s where an AI audit or consultation comes in. Just think of this like a business health check before making a big investment,And here’s why it’s worth doing first: Not all tasks should be automated; some processes, like high-touch sales, are better handled by people, while others, like qualifying leads, scheduling, or FAQ handling, are perfect for AI. Without a proper review, you risk wasting money automating the wrong things. An audit helps  you get a clear ROI roadmap, showing where AI will save hours per week, which tasks will cut costs, and how long it’ll take to see ROI, turning AI hype into real business outcomes. Finally, it reduces mistakes, integrating AI without a plan often leads to missed leads from bad workflows, customer frustration from chatbots that don’t answer properly, or compliance/security risks from handling sensitive data wrong; an audit prevents these headaches. the bottom line is that  an AI audit/consultation helps small business owners figure out where AI makes sense and where it doesn’t.

It does show it should be delivered soon.

I use Square to send invoices and collect payment for all of the items that I have sold so far. Yesterday I got an email from Square saying that I got my first credit card payment dispute. It says that they have not received their items. For context, it was a $350 invoice that they had made multiple payments on for over a period of almost 3 months. When they paid it off I did was not able to immediately ship the items. But was in contact with the customer. When they had asked me if the items were shipped yet I was honest and told them the truth, which was that their items were ready to go out but I was having issues with USPS not picking items up when I requested for pickup. I ended up walking their package up to the post office on Monday September 15th, as I stated that I would do in a message to them. I hadn&amp;#39;t heard anything from them at all... until yesterday when I got the email from square about the payment dispute.It says I have until the 27th to respond with evidence and my side, which I still neee to do, but I checked the tracking and it is still not arrived to them.  It does show it should be delivered soon. I did send them a message with tracking information and apologizing they hadn&amp;#39;t received the items yet, and stated that items were sent when I said they would be, which the tracking information shows. They left my message on read. Then again today I did reach out to them asking if they would cancel the dispute once their items were received. Again they read the message, but no response. \nSo I&amp;#39;m wondering if I should try to intercept the package from ever being delivered to them? Opinions? \nI always hear that the card disputes are solved in favor of the cardholder and I don&amp;#39;t want to be out the $350 and the items if at all possible! Honestly times have been tough lately and I dont even have the money in my account for them to take out, so I will be overdrawn and incur more charges. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"Admirable-Lemon-876","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nngszz/advice_needed_should_i_try_to_intercept_delivery/","domain":"self.smallbusiness","score":9,"num_comments":17,"created_utc":1758529252,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnf6u2","subreddit":"smallbusiness","title":"Shipping questions","selftext":"Hi!

I wanted to share a quick case study / how-to from my recent project. I had a client with a cool product (a home workout kit) but their Amazon listing was…underwhelming. Very generic copy. We did a makeover focusing on some classic copywriting principles, and sales jumped ~35% the following week.\n\n🤯\nHere’s what we changed:\n\n1. Lead with an emotional benefit: The original copy started with product specs. I replaced that first line with a benefit-driven statement: “Achieve gym-quality results at home – feel the burn, minus the commute.” – Immediately tells the customer what’s in it for them (convenience + results).\n\n2. Sprinkle in sensory and power words: We added words like “sculpt”, “exclusive program”, “effortless 15-minute routines” to make it more vivid and appealing. Language that evokes feeling &gt; dry facts.\n\n3. Added social proof: Worked in a one-liner testimonial from a beta user: “Surpassed my expectations – my go-to daily workout now.” This builds trust.\n\n4. Clear CTA: The original description kind of just… ended. We added a gentle nudge: “Ready to transform? Get your kit today and start your journey!” – sometimes people need to be told to take action.\n\n5. Format for readability: Broke a long wall of text into bullet points highlighting key benefits (fast setup, all-in-one kit, etc.). Easier to read = more likely to be read.\n\nBonus: I actually used an AI prompt tool I built (if you’re curious: it’s a Notion library of writing prompts) to generate some copy variations and cherry-picked the best phrases. Really sped things up.\n\nResults: Conversion rate on the listing went from ~8% to ~11% within a week of the new copy (the client has consistent traffic volume, so it was a noticeable lift). The product also got a couple of new reviews mentioning “description was accurate” which was nice validation.\n\nTakeaway: Don’t sleep on your product descriptions! A few copy tweaks – especially focusing on benefits, emotional triggers, and social proof – can make a tangible difference in sales. If anyone’s interested in the prompt I used for the AI or wants me to critique their product copy, let me know in the comments. Happy to help a fellow marketer out.\n\n🙂\nWhat do you think?
