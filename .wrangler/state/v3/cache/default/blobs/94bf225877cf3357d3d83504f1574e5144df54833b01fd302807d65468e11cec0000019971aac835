Probably the most annoying one is when they upend meetings with the following:\n\n\"Hey guys, I know you are saying that the scope is practically impossible, but I just asked perplexity and it found 2 research papers in 30 seconds, so it is possible and we will move forward with implementing them\"\n\nAnd this would be in the middle of a room of SMEs that just described how difficult to impossible the task is for one of my sub teams.  Taking beyond a 30 second look at these research papers would tell anyone that  they didn't fit our scope or solve the issues we had, and reimplementing them into something that is actually production ready is not going to be as easy as he always seems to think.\n\nI won't go into my job or how it operates, and let me preface this, I don't have the time or support infrastructure in place to make proper production applications, let alone MVPs. Yet as of recently, my core team has been(in addition to our other responsibilities) responsible for taking my sub team's code and hack job productionizing them, with the sub teams being told they essentially need to make MVPs when they don't have the skill, know how, or time just because my boss writes checks with his mouth he can't deliver. I can't explain what we can do to solve it without revealing who we are, but take my word that it's almost impossible.\n\nFor a totally separate client, we had a 3rd party team that I interfaced with make a PoC for a client, and based off the client feedback it was okay at the end of the contract. The client comes back 3 months later complaining that the PoC has too many bugs and things he doesn't like about it to show and shop around. So my boss sits me down and says I need to take it and fix it. I tell him that it was just a PoC and we don't have time to re-write this additional codebase. So guess who has to find time to make this codebase a priority and make it more MVP like :). \n\nI looked at the codebase and it's total AI slop, just piecemealed together to get something working. I told my boss and client that we would need to re-write the entire backend instead of Frankensteining it more to get it working, which will take a few months with all of our other priorities. My boss says \"just use AI, you will get it done in a week or so!\" In front of the client 🙃. He then starts to push onto the client how we could revamp the UI and add all of these UI changes. I explain that due to them using the framework they did, anything beyond simple changes would necessitate a full re-write in a real UI framework. I get told back \"have you heard of Vercel V0, Lovable, etc.... just use one of those and you will get a fully functional UI in minutes, so I'm not worried about scope creep.\" This man has never touched a code base in his life, never made an app/website with code, but yet he is lecturing me on how AI can just do it for us 😁.This is not even taking into account it needs to be in a MVP stage which is beyond what we originally were contracted to do.\n\nWhen I read the article, it triggered me and gave me these flashbacks. I don't know if I'm being too stubborn/close minded, but I think that AI is going to enable more people to think it's just that easy and let them lecture real programmers who knows how hard it is.","author":"aaaafireball","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nnjyoq/would_you_be_annoyed_if_your_boss_used_ai_to/","domain":"futurism.com","score":167,"num_comments":64,"created_utc":1758540724,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nmrkyr","subreddit":"programming","title":"12 Git commands visualized in 3D: a spatial approach to understanding version control","selftext":"","author":"initcommit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nmrkyr/12_git_commands_visualized_in_3d_a_spatial/","domain":"youtube.com","score":71,"num_comments":7,"created_utc":1758460270,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nn0yiu","subreddit":"programming","title":"DXGI debugging: Microsoft put me on a list","selftext":"","author":"waitthatsamoon","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nn0yiu/dxgi_debugging_microsoft_put_me_on_a_list/","domain":"slugcat.systems","score":73,"num_comments":7,"created_utc":1758482407,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nn3azq","subreddit":"programming","title":"Taking a Look at Compression Algorithms","selftext":"","author":"Helpful_Geologist430","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nn3azq/taking_a_look_at_compression_algorithms/","domain":"cefboud.com","score":57,"num_comments":8,"created_utc":1758487880,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nmrvm2","subreddit":"programming","title":"Introduction to HotSpot JVM C2 JIT Compiler, Part 0","selftext":"","author":"SereneCalathea","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nmrvm2/introduction_to_hotspot_jvm_c2_jit_compiler_part_0/","domain":"eme64.github.io","score":14,"num_comments":2,"created_utc":1758461049,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nng8c1","subreddit":"programming","title":"Depth of Field with OpenGL","selftext":"","author":"PeterBrobby","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nng8c1/depth_of_field_with_opengl/","domain":"youtu.be","score":11,"num_comments":2,"created_utc":1758526946,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nmwzmn","subreddit":"programming","title":"Seven stages teams go through with their software tech stack","selftext":"","author":"robbyrussell","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nmwzmn/seven_stages_teams_go_through_with_their_software/","domain":"robbyonrails.com","score":9,"num_comments":1,"created_utc":1758473322,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nndksl","subreddit":"programming","title":"Mill as an Alternative Android Build Tool","selftext":"","author":"lihaoyi","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nndksl/mill_as_an_alternative_android_build_tool/","domain":"mill-build.org","score":5,"num_comments":2,"created_utc":1758517095,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnln86","subreddit":"programming","title":"Netflix's Livestreaming Disaster: The Engineering Challenge of Streaming at Scale","selftext":"","author":"Ani171202","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nnln86/netflixs_livestreaming_disaster_the_engineering/","domain":"anirudhsathiya.com","score":3,"num_comments":0,"created_utc":1758545575,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nmuzlb","subreddit":"programming","title":"Type Stubs and Typeshed in Python: A Developer’s Guide","selftext":"","author":"wyhjsbyb","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nmuzlb/type_stubs_and_typeshed_in_python_a_developers/","domain":"medium.com","score":3,"num_comments":0,"created_utc":1758468632,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnlfua","subreddit":"programming","title":"How to Generate Realistic Fake Logs with Python, Docker, and Kubernetes","selftext":"Logging pipelines are code too — but testing them often gets skipped because of missing data.

I wanted to find out if that’s just perception or something you can actually measure, so i wired up a harness that runs the same coding/debugging tasks across multiple providers on a schedule and tracks how they drift.\n\nThe hard part wasn’t the charts, it was making the tests fair and repeatable. I ended up using small, unit-testable Python tasks, salting prompts to avoid provider-side caching, running the generated code in a sandbox with time/memory limits, and taking medians over a few trials to dampen noise. Scores are broken down by correctness, code quality signals, efficiency/latency, stability (variance across trials), and a couple of “did it fall on its face?” axes for refusals and brittle fixes. There’s also a historical baseline so a model that suddenly “feels different” shows up as an actual deviation instead of vibes.\n\nIt’s open source and free i’m not selling anything and there are no ads. I honestly built it to sanity-check my own workflow, but it ended up getting way more traffic in the first week than i expected, which tells me a lot of devs are running into the same thing.\n\nIf you want to kick the tires or critique the methodology, I’d love feedback.

Process breakdown below.\n\nWhen done correctly, this can increase activation rate, retention, conversion rate AND reduce churn - improving all KPIs that boost your SaaS valuation.\n\n**The system (4 steps):**\n\n**1. Track everything with a CDP.** Connect all your SaaS user data sources to track every action. Some that I like: RudderStack, PostHog, Segment, amplitude (has some CDP-like features). CDPs allow you to create a unified customer view where you learn your users key drop off points - crucial for product led growth.\n\n**2. Connect to email platform.** Link to your chosen email marketing platform - my favorite email marketing platforms for SAAS are; Loops so, Customer io &amp; Encharge. Segment users based on actions and current stage. Audience segments are constantly updated via API.\n\n**3. Deploy these 9 core flows.** Value-focused multi-step flows to guide users to the next stage. Not spam - only triggered by what they have/haven't done.\n\n* **Welcome** \\- Coach to first \"Aha!\" moment (Trigger: Account created)\n* **Onboarding** \\- Feature education tied to use-case (Trigger: Key milestone/action completed)\n* **No-Login** \\- Re-engage silent users (Trigger: No login for n days)\n* **Gamification/Progress** \\- Celebrate wins, create momentum (Trigger: Task completion)\n* **Feature Limitation** \\- Highlight premium features (Trigger: Gated feature attempt/ tokens limit reached/near)\n* **Referral** \\- Turn users into advocates (Trigger: Activation milestone)\n* **Cancellation** \\- Rescue at-risk accounts (Trigger: Viewed cancellation page x times)\n* **Abandoned Payment** \\- Recover failed checkouts (Trigger: Checkout started &amp; not completed)\n* **Payment Declined** \\- Prevent involuntary churn (Trigger: Charge failed)\n\nThere will be more flows that are unique to your app though these 9 apply to the majority of SaaS. Other examples of flows you might want to implement to drive product led growth are; testimonial/review request flow, user feedback/survey flow and feature request flows.\n\n**4. A/B test and optimize.** Test messaging at every stage. Route data to dashboards showing which emails drive upgrades and how key SaaS growth metrics improve.\n\n**Example - Simple math to show potential impact:**  \nLet's say you have 100 trial signups → 40% activate → 15% of those convert = 6 paying customers\n\nIf your automated flows boost activation by 20 points: 100 signups → 60% activate → 15% convert = 9 customers (50% increase)\n\nAt scale:  \n1,000 signups: 60 vs 90 paid users  \n10,000 signups: 600 vs 900 paid users\n\n*Note: I'm using 15% activation-to-paid conversion which is conservative - many SaaS see higher rates with proper flows. the purpose of this example is to show the value of increasing activation rates using this system*\n\nAs your product scales, this lever will provide more significant results. This example doesn't touch on other crucial benefits such as; churn reduction, improved feature adoption, higher retention, and increased engagement throughout the customer lifecycle.\n\n**When this works best:** When you have reached product-market fit and have a consistent user acquisition channel where small improvements will begin to compound fast at scale.\n\nI've compiled 500+ real email examples from successful SaaS companies across these flow types (as well as other flow/campaign types) - might be helpful when planning your own flows/emails. let me know if you would like it.","author":"StrikingAngle882","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nmztvt/how_to_increase_saas_trial_conversions_improve/","domain":"self.SaaS","score":8,"num_comments":6,"created_utc":1758479856,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nmrx5t","subreddit":"SaaS","title":"Title: Drop your SaaS link if it’s a year or older- I’ll share a free SEO audit report","selftext":"Hi,\n\nIf your SaaS has already reached a mature stage but you’re still not satisfied with your client/sign-up flow, there may be loopholes on your website, landing page, or social media outreach.  \n  \n**To help you identify them, I’m offering a free SEO audit report,  just drop your website or landing page link.I will share the complete audit report.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n  \nAlso, please have a look of our recently launched AI-powered platform [**CMSai**](http://www.cmsai.net) that combines ALL marketing services, SEO, social media marketing, blogging, video marketing, and website maintenance, into a single solution.\n\n\\--The goal is to help businesses **generate leads, grow followers, and expand online outreach** more efficiently.\n\nTo put it in perspective, hiring a full marketing team can cost at least **$15,000 per month**, whereas with this platform, you can access all these services for **under $1,800**, while driving more leads and increasing your online presence.\n\nThe platform is still in its early stages, having launched just a few weeks ago, and we’re currently offering **special perks**, including a free marketing plan.\n\nThanks!!","author":"Inevitable_Teach187","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nmrx5t/title_drop_your_saas_link_if_its_a_year_or_older/","domain":"self.SaaS","score":9,"num_comments":38,"created_utc":1758461159,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnkl1p","subreddit":"SaaS","title":"How much salary do you give yourself?","selftext":"There are many builders just reliant on MRR and taking a flexible amount to survive.

I sourced the product from China and split the cost with him. His dad gave him the money and I used my own money for my half. We began running ads, but he insisted on having some dude his dad knows run the ads, and he ended up doing an insanely tiny budget over 2 weeks and then not running ads again. We still made 2 sales but anytime I’d ask my friend to have the guy run ads again (meta ads account was in his name) , he’d kind of just avoid it. He had much more free time than me and we’d still talk often but any time I’d bring up the business, he’d just avoid it. After months of nagging him and little interest from his side, I created my own Instagram account for the brand and began running ads in the beginning of September. I’ve since sold nearly a quarter of the stock and found a cheaper supplier to restock the more popular variants of the product (new stock still hasn’t arrived). At this point, I’m running ads, handling customers and packing orders entirely on my own, and I haven’t said a word to him about it. It’s pretty evident that he couldn’t care less if the stock gets sold or if he makes his initial investment back, but sooner or later, he might catch wind of what I’m doing, and I don’t intend of cheating him out of anything either, and all this is made even more complicated by the new stock I ordered entirely on my own, which will improve the margins and make it much easier to make back the initial investment.

When they paid it off I did was not able to immediately ship the items. But was in contact with the customer. When they had asked me if the items were shipped yet I was honest and told them the truth, which was that their items were ready to go out but I was having issues with USPS not picking items up when I requested for pickup. I ended up walking their package up to the post office on Monday September 15th, as I stated that I would do in a message to them. I hadn't heard anything from them at all... until yesterday when I got the email from square about the payment dispute.It says I have until the 27th to respond with evidence and my side, which I still neee to do, but I checked the tracking and it is still not arrived to them.  It does show it should be delivered soon. I did send them a message with tracking information and apologizing they hadn't received the items yet, and stated that items were sent when I said they would be, which the tracking information shows. They left my message on read. Then again today I did reach out to them asking if they would cancel the dispute once their items were received. Again they read the message, but no response. \nSo I'm wondering if I should try to intercept the package from ever being delivered to them?

As a Japanese learner and a coder, I've always wanted there to be an open-source, 100% free for learning Japanese, similar to Monkeytype in the typing community.\n\nUnfortunately, pretty much all language learning apps are closed-sourced and paid these days, and the ones that are free have unfortunately been abandoned.\n\nBut of course, just creating yet another language learning app was not enough - there has to be a unique selling point. So I thought: why not make it crazy and do what no other language learning app ever did and add a gazillion different color themes and fonts, to really hit it home and honor the app's original inspiration, Monkeytype?\n\nAnd so I did. Now, I'm looking to find contributors and testers for the early stages of the app (though we already have a couple thousand monthly users, and they seem to be loving the idea so far!)\n\nBut, I need your help. It's kinda hard for a free and open-source project to compete with paid, closed-source language learning solutions - so, if you or a friend of yours are into Japanese or coding, please help us out by by giving us a star on Github or, even better, contributing to the project (pwease :,)\n\nWhy am I doing this? Because weebs and otakus deserve to have a 100% free, beautiful, quality language learning app too!

Frontend UIs, async bugs, backend APIs, build chains, observability… and when something breaks, it’s rarely just “a line of code.”\n\nIt’s often a human moment: misread logs, tunnel vision in the debugger, a race condition you couldn’t see coming.\n\nThat’s where I think aviation safety has a ton to teach us. I’ve spent the last year researching real-world aviation accidents (AF447, Helios 522, Tenerife, Qantas 32), and I kept asking: what if software engineering took human factors this seriously?\n\nHere are 3 lessons I think apply directly to the world of JavaScript development:\n\n1) Surface system “modes” clearly - Helios 522, 2005\nA mode switch left in the wrong setting doomed a flight. The crew didn’t notice, and UI design failed them.\n\nJS relevance: Mode confusion is real in software too: are we in staging or prod? Is that button disabled because of a flag or a race? What state is this component actually in?\n\n→ Make modes loud. Add visual markers in dev tools, console banners for envs, visible toggles for feature flags. State needs to shout under stress.\n\n2) Situational awareness is a role, not a side effect -Eastern 401, 1972\nThe crew got fixated on a landing gear light and crashed. Nobody was tracking the big picture.\n\nJS relevance: Ever debugged an issue and realized hours later it wasn’t the real problem? Or missed that a caching layer was involved?\n\n→ Assign someone to keep a full-system view during incidents or deep bugs-especially when working across frontend/backend boundaries. Someone who’s not hands-on-keyboard, but watching what matters.\n\n3) Train for uncertainty, not just happy paths - Qantas 32, 2010\nAn explosion led to cascading alerts. What saved the plane? A crew trained to prioritize and think critically under uncertainty.\n\nJS relevance: Are your devs only trained on smooth dev workflows? Can they diagnose a stale state bug, or cascading API failures in prod?\n\n→ Add “messy drills” to your retros or team demos. Break a small thing (e.g., async race, flaky flag, bad cache) and time how quickly the root cause emerges. Debrief not just what broke-but how you noticed.\n\nIf this sort of thinking resonates, I wrote a book  „Code from the cockpit“ that expands these ideas-from cockpit failures to software recovery strategies. It’s not a checklist book; it’s about how humans, systems, and design interact.\n\nWould love to hear: how do you design for failure in JS-heavy systems?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!\n\nSo I work as a fashion designer. My last role was at a well-known Fortune 500 company, the leader in my industry. I was a contract employee for over a year, but my contract ran out in and despite my best efforts, I was unemployed for a bit.\n\nI started a new job recently at a smaller, lesser-known company. As a designer, the product is not as interesting and the work is not as stimulating. The pay is similar to my last role but I have a higher title.\n\nI was still applying throughout my interviewing phase, of course, so am still getting emails for these jobs I applied for. So now I am in another interview phase with a well-known, well-established start-up brand whose product I enjoy and would look quite nice on the resume. The work is more in line with my experience and what I love to do. However, the role is my old job title and it doesn’t pay as well as my current job, though perhaps I could talk them up if I got an offer. Technically I am overqualified, but I am still interested.

Key technical features:\n\n* **Gymnasium-compliant interface** \\- drop-in replacement for existing workflows\n* **Stable-Baselines3 integration** \\- works out-of-the-box with PPO, SAC, TD3, etc.\n* **Efficient state management** \\- leverages native emulator save states for fast episode resets\n* **Configurable observation spaces** \\- raw pixels, processed features, or memory states\n* **Action space mapping** \\- handles complex controller inputs to discrete/continuous actions\n\nCurrently supports 4 emulator backends with plans for modern console integration (PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U). The environment abstracts away emulator-specific APIs while preserving access to low-level features when needed.\n\n**Technical implementation highlights:**\n\n* SDL-based architecture for minimal overhead\n* Memory mapping support for game-specific feature extraction\n* Reproducible training through deterministic save state handling\n* Multi-game training capabilities within single environment instance\n\nThis opens up training on thousands of diverse games vs. the typical handful of custom environments.

I will not promote","selftext":"I never raised VC money. Not once. Everything I built was bootstrapped.\n\nIn 2010, I started a consulting firm called Weavora with two partners.\n\nI took sales calls from my car on lunch breaks, then worked nights in our tiny office with ragged curtains and cheap desks.\n\nMy first big challenge was finding clients on Odesk. Back then, even a brand-new profile could win jobs if you wrote thoughtful replies. We found an approach that worked and kept using it. That’s how we landed our first clients.\n\nOutsourcing grew quick. That is probably the fastest way to get started. But the dark side showed up too: endless deadlines, unrealistic demands, and brilliant work thrown in the trash.\n\nWe even worked with a big public company on an important project. Success, right?\n\nBut we didn’t feel like we were doing what we loved. We didn’t want to follow the typical outsourcing path, growing wide, hiring and training people, only to watch them leave. We wanted to stay a small team. My idols at that time were Teehan+Lax\n\nBy 2014, we wanted to try something different. Everyone around us was chasing products, not projects.\n\nWe tested a few ideas. Only one stuck: Everhour.\n\nAt first it was just a side project. By 2016, we shut down consulting and went all-in.\n\nGrowth came naturally through SEO, integrations, and content. Back then, project management tools didn’t have built-in time tracking. We filled that gap.\n\nIt worked. Within a few years Everhour hit $1M ARR with no outside funding. Today it’s multiple times bigger.\n\nBut many advantages slowly faded and we decided to start something new in parallel. We thought that growing another product from 0 to $1M ARR felt more realistic than trying to add the same amount on top of an older, slower-growing one.\n\nWell, it is tough. Starting a new company feels harder and slower than supporting an existing one. It’s tough when expectations don’t match reality.\n\nBootstrapping isn’t sexy. And I can’t say it’s the right path for everyone.\n\nBootstrapping means living on revenue, always keeping a buffer, always staying disciplined. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. And it pulls you in.\n\nOne unwritten rule we set for ourselves and never broke was this: never quit a job or shut down a business until the next one could at least cover basic salaries. That rule gave us resilience.\n\nNow, at almost 40, I’m slowly learning something else, that balance matters more than the race. Sleep debt and stress always come due.\n\nLiving in Cyprus with my family, with the sea and nature around me, I see that building companies is also about building a life.\n\nThe biggest lessons? \n\nFirst - everything has its time and when people talk about their success, they often underestimate the role of luck. A lot of it comes down to being in the right place at the right time.\n\nSecond - don’t just chase opportunity. We kept starting new things to stay alive, curious, and energized. Losing money hurts.
