I sourced the product from China and split the cost with him. His dad gave him the money and I used my own money for my half. We began running ads, but he insisted on having some dude his dad knows run the ads, and he ended up doing an insanely tiny budget over 2 weeks and then not running ads again. We still made 2 sales but anytime I’d ask my friend to have the guy run ads again (meta ads account was in his name) , he’d kind of just avoid it. He had much more free time than me and we’d still talk often but any time I’d bring up the business, he’d just avoid it. After months of nagging him and little interest from his side, I created my own Instagram account for the brand and began running ads in the beginning of September.

We still made 2 sales but anytime I’d ask my friend to have the guy run ads again (meta ads account was in his name) , he’d kind of just avoid it. He had much more free time than me and we’d still talk often but any time I’d bring up the business, he’d just avoid it.

This worked for me for years, but people are getting smarter. With the rise of ai, the growth of social media, and the continuing trend of people hating capitalism, collecting emails is getting harder. At the same time, emails have never been more valuable.\n\nMost people would rather shop with a friend instead of a brand. This post is going to show you how to lead with value, become more personable, and create a real relationship with your customers. \n\n**Have you ever collected emails from a page with no products or collections?**\n\nIf you're answer is no, ask yourself why not?\n\nYou can collect 8-10 times more emails by sending people to a landing page that has nothing for sale. If you're just dropshipping bullshit, this entire post is probably meaningless to you. But, if you plan on building your brand and planning on operating it 5 years from now, this marketing angle could be a game-changer for you.\n\nLet's talk about lead generation landing pages. What you can offer in exchange for an email, how to design the landing pages, and how you can get traffic.   \n  \n**What Makes a Lead Gen Page Convert**\n\nKeep it simple.\n\n* Headline that tells them what they’re getting\n* Subheadline that supports the offer\n* One short form (just email or phone)\n* Clean product or lifestyle visual\n* Social proof (logos, reviews, screenshots)\n* Zero distractions (no nav, no links)\n\nExample headlines:\n\n* Join 10,000+ members in our monthly giveaway.\n* Giveaways. Drops. Secret deals. All for email subscribers only.\n* Get the free \\[ebook title\\] + weekly content that actually helps\n* Join the movement. Tools, tips, and updates before anyone else.\n\nThis works whether you're running Reddit traffic, paid traffic, or pushing them from blog content.\n\n# The Offer: What Do People Get for Submitting Their Email?\n\nDon't overcomplicate this. Just offer something they'd actually want right now.\n\nHere are some of the best lead magnets we've seen work across different brands I've built landing pages for:\n\n* **Giveaways** Great for hyping product drops, collecting UGC, or building waitlists. Example: \"Enter to win our summer bundle. Winner announced next week.\"\n* **Niche Ebooks or Guides** This works when your product needs some education or explanation. Example: If you sell skincare, offer a “7-Day Glow-Up Routine” guide.\n* **Early Access or Waitlists** Works well for limited drops, seasonal restocks, or product launches. Example: \"Be the first to shop our winter collection.\"\n* **VIP Clubs or Secret Stores** Create exclusivity. Example: \"Join our VIP list for early access and members-only offers.\"\n* **Quizzes** Personalized and interactive. Example: “Find your perfect match in 30 seconds.”\n\nWhatever you offer, make it feel instant and valuable.  \nNo need to pitch your brand. Just pitch the reason to sign up.\n\n\n\n# Giveaway Leads\n\n**Goal:** Build curiosity and connection. These leads aren't ready to buy.\n\n**What to send:**\n\n* Giveaway confirmation and what to expect\n* Brand story or founder intro\n* UGC and real reviews\n* Behind-the-scenes or product breakdown\n* A blog post or tip-based email\n\nNo hard pitches. Keep it fun and on-brand. These poeple are greta to re-target back into your community. They may never buy, but they will open your emails, comment on your posts ,and maybe even recommend your brand to a friend. \n\n# Ebook or Guide Leads\n\n**Goal:** Educate first, then position the product as the next step.\n\n**What to send:**\n\n* Ebook delivery with a short intro\n* A tip or insight from the content\n* A story or case study\n* Light CTA with zero pressure\n* New blog posts\n* Relevant products\n\nLet the value do the work. Warm them up without pushing too hard.\n\n# Use Blog Content to Nurture\n\nLink relevant blog content in your flows. These posts help build authority and trust.\n\nExamples:\n\n* 3 ways our customers use this every day\n* Why 60% of buyers come back\n* Tips from the team behind \\[brand name\\]\n\n*This is how you turn a cold signup into a fan who actually wants your emails.*\n\n  \nAfter you run these leads through a nurture flow, you begin to send segmented campaigns that send these warm leads to your main website. \n\n# How to Drive Traffic to Your Lead Gen Pages\n\nYou’ve got the offer. You’ve got the flow. Now you just need people to hit the page.\n\nHere are a few ways to drive **qualified traffic** without needing a product page or paid funnel.\n\n# 1. Reddit (low-cost, high-trust)\n\nThis is the best organic traffic source if you’re willing to play the long game.\n\n* Build a subreddit for your niche, not your brand\n* Post value-driven content 4 to 6 times a week\n* Use Reddit DM tools to message users who mention your niche\n* Pin the lead gen page in your sub once it has momentum\n\nNo hard pitch. Just focus on building a space that feels helpful. The traffic and email signups follow.\n\n# 2. Paid Ads (but not how most people use them)\n\nSend cold traffic to your lead gen page. Not to a product page. Not to a catalog.\n\nJust a single-page offer:\n\n* Giveaway signup\n* Waitlist\n* Niche ebook\n* Free tool or checklist\n\nYour only goal is to collect the email. The backend will convert.\n\nBonus: you’re also building retargeting audiences at the same time. You're going to massively increase the volume of emails you collect that can be used in retargeting campaigns. \n\n# 3. Blog Content + SEO\n\nWrite keyword-targeted blog posts that solve specific problems in your niche.\n\nAt the end of each post, offer something free:\n\n* \"Download the checklist\"\n* \"Grab our free guide\"\n* \"Join the community giveaway\"\n\nYou’ll start collecting emails from people who are already searching for answers. These are some of the warmest leads you can get.\n\n# 4. Organic Social Content\n\nTurn short-form content into mini magnets.\n\nInstagram, TikTok, Facebook Groups, X  all of them work if you lead with value.\n\nDrop soft CTAs:\n\n* \"We’re giving away $250 in gear. Join the list.\"\n* \"Comment 'Hike' for a free ebook that includes the best trails in America and elite hiking tips\"\n* \"Want first dibs on our new release? Join the waitlist.\"\n\nKeep it casual. Push the benefit, not the brand. People who sell info products use these funnels all the time. In fact, basically any MMO guru is using an email funnel that leads to a webinar to sell high-ticket products to warm leads. In the past, ecom store owners never had to go this deep. Today, it's a lot different. But if anyone knows how to extract money out of consumers, it's the influencer grifters. Take note of the high ticket funnels, because that's where mid-high ticket ecom marketing is going. \n\n  \n**Final Thoughts**\n\nMost brands are stuck chasing sales from cold traffic. But there's real power behind the backend marketing. \n\nEvery email you collect is more than just a lead. It’s a retargeting audience, a future buyer, a potential referral, and a compounding asset that works even when your ad account gets shut down. Your email list is the only thing you truly own. If you treat it right, it’ll return value every single month.\n\nThe brands that win long-term are the ones that build trust first. They use real nurture flows, strong content, and segmentation to turn cold leads into warm ones who open, engage, and buy.\n\nA great funnel doesn’t just get someone to buy. It builds a relationship, so they keep coming back. If your backend is right, you won’t need to rely on paid ads forever.\n\nWhile building subreddits for niche ecom brands, I figured out quickly that we can't sell directly on Reddit. Once we got the users off reddit, onto a landing page,  and into our email list, we were able to successfully monetize organic traffic. \n\nThe buyers we get from our landing pages are 5x more likely to buy more than once than the buyers that come from cold traffic (ads or influencers). I'll leave it at that.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most brands rely on popouts and abandoned checkouts to grow their email lists.

Here's what went wrong and went well.","selftext":"Little back story, I work a “9-5”, 4 days a week for 10H as a software developer. I work 4 days to have extra time on Fridays, so I can work on my own products and try to gain MRR, so I can eventually stop working for the “9-5” and focus on my own products and clients.\n\nIt all started with me in the shower on the 11th of September. I had an idea, jumped out of the shower. wrote it down in my notepad and forgot about it a for a bit. The next day I went to the gym and thought about the same idea a bit more and texted some people about the idea(I trust their feedback). Those people gave me the confidence to follow this through.

Well I didn’t want to be the twelfth egg in the dozen, so I had to find another angle. That's when it hit me, A Roast! I am tired of always receiving the same kind of feedback when talking to AI. So what if I turn my requested feedback about my website in a roast? In that way I get feedback and a laugh (hopefully).\n\n12th of September \\~10pm I started with the help of my good friend Claude planning the project requirements. What stack I’d be using, what AI tools I would integrate for the roasting of the websites. After a short planning session I started setting up the architecture and went to bed.\n\nBecause I thought this would be a fast project I started with Supabase as my supplier for authentication and database. Stripe as my payment platform because I am familiar with it.\n\nThe first few days went smooth and on a Monday 15 September I thought I was on a roll and I would be able to release this thing on a Thursday 6PM the 140H mark. So I announced it on X. I even started teasing the logo AI generated. I couldn’t have been more wrong.\n\nThe Roasts were working, I was able to roast my own website with different agents, but the roasts were very predictable. The ability to actually listen to roasts was a good thing. I had a lot of laughs during testing. I started working on the AI agent feedback system. That went smooth as well. The next Wednesday (17 Sept.), I was certain I was going to make the release. So I purchased the Domain and added it to my Vercel project. I started preparing for launch. Only doing small tweaks. But then I had the brilliant Idea to make the payment system a little bit more dynamic and scalable for the future by fetching available payment options. This is where my week turned into a nightmare.\n\nOut of nowhere, my payment system wasn’t working anymore. The form wasn’t loading anymore. My Opera browser started seeing my Stripe form as an advertisement. So after debugging for 2-3 hours I decided to test it in Chrome, same issues. Firefox, same issues. I was very tired so I wasn’t really using my brain. I forgot to properly work with version control. Prior to my last commit I already made some changes to the payment logic. And because I started to really rely on Claude I lost control of it.\n\nShit, I didn’t know what to do, I even opened PHPStorm and started digging through my Local history on PHPStorm, to no result, because I don’t really use it for front-end projects. Instead of making a back-up and being really tired and not thinking straight I made the decision to store the current state of the code to a new branch and start over with the improvements I made before messing with the payment system. That went smooth, because I coded it once before so I kinda knew it. After a long stressful annoying night, I went to bed at \\~2AM, satisfied.\n\nThe next morning after a short night of sleep, It was Thursday, the day of the “announced” release. I was very tired. Around 1PM I decided to call it quits for the 9-5 and make up the time next week. I needed to deploy Pagerekt to Vercel. I was making some last minute changes on my personal PC to Pagerekt and was ready to deploy. I needed to restart my local dev server a couple of times. But my personal PC is Windows and for the life of me my local dev server wouldn’t shut down properly.\n\nI decided to grab my Macbook, which I normally don’t use for personal projects and started working from there. First I had to quickly get that up and running. Finally I had all the control I needed over my project. I deployed my project in the hope that I could properly test it before the launch at 6PM. Vercel hit me with the fact that my personal version control account is different than the one from my 9-5. So I had to convert my free account in to a “team” account and had to pay $20/month for the “team” subscription and another $20/month for an extra “seat”. Oh I so didn’t care, I just wanted my project live and working.\n\nFinally the project was deployed and I could start the testing. Then the real problems started to occur. My firebase authentication wasn’t working properly. When I was able to log in, and tried to generate a free roast, the roast timed out. After researching that was an easy fix. But the authentication seemed to be a consistent problem. I focussed heavily on the buggy authentication. It was 6PM, I still wasn’t able to have a stable session.\n\nShit I missed my launch. That’s okay, no reason to give up now. The entire night I spend rebuilding the authentication from Supabase to NextJS Auth. (Best decision I’ve made, this entire project). At 3AM with the authentication being stable, but not being able to create roasts, I went to bed.\n\nThe Friday morning I woke up on the late side of my normal schedule. I grabbed breakfast and went straight to my computer. I fixed the issues that were causing users not being able to create roasts. Then I became lazy and I told Claude to remove my debugging code. He started working on it. After a bit he suggested using a script to remove every debug line. With my still sleepy head I read the script, it looked good, It wasn’t. All of a sudden 1800 errors appeared in my code. Frick, what just happened? Claude also thought it was a good idea to try and solve it. Now there were \\~2500 errors. My blood was cooking, to calm down, I went to the gym. During my gym session I realized I didn’t commit my fixed issues (again). I was furious, the same mistake in less than a week?\n\nBehind my MacBook again after the gym session I tried to fix all \\~2500 errors by hand. After 30 minutes I barely made a dent in the list of errors. There was no way I was going to fix all \\~2500 errors by hand. I had to resort to resetting to my last commit and losing all of my progress again.\n\nNow with a clear goal in mind I started fixing all of the bugs that stopped users from being able to make roasts. Committing every little fix that I did. I made some improvements. I launched it and did some live testing to make sure roasts where being able to be made, payments went through etc. After calling it a day, my partner told me I looked tired. So I went to the bathroom and checked my self in the mirror. Yes I looked very tired, in my mind I just fought a war.\n\nSo after \\~20 hours of being live with my latest product Pagerekt , I had the time to reflect what happened last 160H. My learning are: It’s okay to commit yourself to a deadline, but keep it healthy. This grind wasn’t healthy. I need to use version control better, after 30-60 minutes of work when I take a break, commit your work. While I am tired I tend to make mistakes that I normally don’t make. Take more breaks. It is okay if your deadline you set for yourself isn’t met, the world isn’t going to end. Working with AI API’s is easier than I originally thought. I can do a lot in a really short time. It is fun to challenge myself.\n\nThis was my story about my 160H rodeo, resulting in Pagerekt a landing page/product roasting tool that gives you feedback but also gives you a good laugh about your own landing page and product.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little back story, I work a “9-5”, 4 days a week for 10H as a software developer.

I stayed in the comments.\nEvery single user issue became a feature. Users told me what was broken, what they loved, and what they wished existed.

Since then I have accumulated \\~$2.9m in net worth via assets (excl. my house and excl. actual business value).\n\nMy business is cyclical and niche, and its very \"key man\", so I don't assign any actual value to the business. Over the last 4 years my industry grew, I made a lot of money, it was very fun, but my industry in 2025 is very slow and I am feeling the impact of hordes of new competition, the recession, and a structurally low growth economy. Business is pitifully slow, and no matter how much actual work I put in, it's not changing my ability to grow. The only path to growth is via risks (ie debt) that I'm not comfortable with. I have made it this far taking almost no risk, and I do not want to go back to 0.\n\n2021-2023 were big, then I made \\~$400k net last year, $500k this year, and I figure I'll make $200k next year if things don't improve. The last 2 years I have worked so hard and without a few random large wins, I would have made $150k max each year.\n\nI have seen what running a business with tailwinds does, and there is nothing like it. It's fun, you can be creative and use all of your talents to the max, you're on top of the world and life is just exhilarating. If I could spend the next 10 years in 2023, I would be worth $100m by 2035 no question. Even without the money, I was so happy because I felt I was using all of my abilities I've worked for so long to develop. I need that back in my life again.\n\n**So here's why I'm posting to** r/Entrepreneur **:** if I continue on this path, even with low growth, I can almost certainly hit $10m by the time I hit 40 yo. The knowledge, experience, relationships, and of course my assets, will continue to compound over the next decade and I will have a little empire.\n\nBut every day I am suffering from anxiety and just so much stress that I'm not doing enough. I tasted what thriving feels like and everything else is dull. More than anything I want to feel like I can express my creativity, grow, and profit... for people who aren't in the business world it's hard to understand, but if you've been there you know how it feels. Growth is life. And not being in that state, it tears you apart.\n\nI have a great wife, family, home, friends, hobbies. No problems there. But I can't retire, I have too much energy and I want that feeling back. But I have no idea where to find it, which is just compounding my anxiety.\n\nAnd I have always used this pent up anxiety and dread at not doing enough as fuel, it has always pushed me, but right now it has nowhere to go and is overflowing and burning a hole in me.\n\nI've spent months looking into new businesses that are adjacent to mine, they're all slowing down too because of the recession / growth issues. And unless I buy a business, ie take on debt, they're very key man driven. I've decided that any \"small business\" that is adjacent to mine would be a downgrade from what I do for a variety of reasons, because I can't directly compound, and if it's going to be a slow growth slog, I might as well continue doing what I am doing because it doesn't require nearly as much work at my stage.\n\n**My question:**\n\nFor those of you who have had early career success and encountered a recession / major slowdown, what did you do? How did you pivot, how did you decide how to dedicate time to an existing business that \"works but isn't thriving\" vs new ventures?\n\nIf you have been in my shoes, have had this painful anxiety that was once helpful, did you continue to use it as fuel? Is this how everyone who craves success just feels?","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started a business in 2021 with ~50k to my name.

I need that back in my life again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So here&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m posting to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"/r/Entrepreneur\"&gt;r/Entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; if I continue on this path, even with low growth, I can almost certainly hit $10m by the time I hit 40 yo. The knowledge, experience, relationships, and of course my assets, will continue to compound over the next decade and I will have a little empire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But every day I am suffering from anxiety and just so much stress that I&amp;#39;m not doing enough. I tasted what thriving feels like and everything else is dull. More than anything I want to feel like I can express my creativity, grow, and profit... for people who aren&amp;#39;t in the business world it&amp;#39;s hard to understand, but if you&amp;#39;ve been there you know how it feels. Growth is life. And not being in that state, it tears you apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a great wife, family, home, friends, hobbies. No problems there. But I can&amp;#39;t retire, I have too much energy and I want that feeling back. But I have no idea where to find it, which is just compounding my anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I have always used this pent up anxiety and dread at not doing enough as fuel, it has always pushed me, but right now it has nowhere to go and is overflowing and burning a hole in me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve spent months looking into new businesses that are adjacent to mine, they&amp;#39;re all slowing down too because of the recession / growth issues. And unless I buy a business, ie take on debt, they&amp;#39;re very key man driven. I&amp;#39;ve decided that any &amp;quot;small business&amp;quot; that is adjacent to mine would be a downgrade from what I do for a variety of reasons, because I can&amp;#39;t directly compound, and if it&amp;#39;s going to be a slow growth slog, I might as well continue doing what I am doing because it doesn&amp;#39;t require nearly as much work at my stage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My question:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have had early career success and encountered a recession / major slowdown, what did you do? How did you pivot, how did you decide how to dedicate time to an existing business that &amp;quot;works but isn&amp;#39;t thriving&amp;quot; vs new ventures?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have been in my shoes, have had this painful anxiety that was once helpful, did you continue to use it as fuel? Is this how everyone who craves success just feels?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"Erniethetoad","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nle2b5/29_yo_29m_nw_i_need_help_i_am_dying_of_anxiety/","domain":"self.Entrepreneur","score":0,"num_comments":5,"created_utc":1758312574,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nldxgd","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","title":"If you had an unlimited budget for ads, where would you spend it when launching your business?","selftext":"Hi everyone!
