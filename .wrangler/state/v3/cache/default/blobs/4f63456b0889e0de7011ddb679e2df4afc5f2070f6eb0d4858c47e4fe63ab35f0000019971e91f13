That’s where an AI audit or consultation comes in. Just think of this like a business health check before making a big investment,And here’s why it’s worth doing first: Not all tasks should be automated; some processes, like high-touch sales, are better handled by people, while others, like qualifying leads, scheduling, or FAQ handling, are perfect for AI. Without a proper review, you risk wasting money automating the wrong things. An audit helps  you get a clear ROI roadmap, showing where AI will save hours per week, which tasks will cut costs, and how long it’ll take to see ROI, turning AI hype into real business outcomes. Finally, it reduces mistakes, integrating AI without a plan often leads to missed leads from bad workflows, customer frustration from chatbots that don’t answer properly, or compliance/security risks from handling sensitive data wrong; an audit prevents these headaches. the bottom line is that  an AI audit/consultation helps small business owners figure out where AI makes sense and where it doesn’t.

When they paid it off I did was not able to immediately ship the items. But was in contact with the customer. When they had asked me if the items were shipped yet I was honest and told them the truth, which was that their items were ready to go out but I was having issues with USPS not picking items up when I requested for pickup. I ended up walking their package up to the post office on Monday September 15th, as I stated that I would do in a message to them. I hadn&amp;#39;t heard anything from them at all... until yesterday when I got the email from square about the payment dispute.It says I have until the 27th to respond with evidence and my side, which I still neee to do, but I checked the tracking and it is still not arrived to them.  It does show it should be delivered soon. I did send them a message with tracking information and apologizing they hadn&amp;#39;t received the items yet, and stated that items were sent when I said they would be, which the tracking information shows. They left my message on read. Then again today I did reach out to them asking if they would cancel the dispute once their items were received. Again they read the message, but no response. \nSo I&amp;#39;m wondering if I should try to intercept the package from ever being delivered to them? Opinions? \nI always hear that the card disputes are solved in favor of the cardholder and I don&amp;#39;t want to be out the $350 and the items if at all possible! Honestly times have been tough lately and I dont even have the money in my account for them to take out, so I will be overdrawn and incur more charges. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"Admirable-Lemon-876","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nngszz/advice_needed_should_i_try_to_intercept_delivery/","domain":"self.smallbusiness","score":8,"num_comments":18,"created_utc":1758529252,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnf6u2","subreddit":"smallbusiness","title":"Shipping questions","selftext":"Hi!

I wanted to share a quick case study / how-to from my recent project. I had a client with a cool product (a home workout kit) but their Amazon listing was…underwhelming. Very generic copy. We did a makeover focusing on some classic copywriting principles, and sales jumped ~35% the following week.\n\n🤯\nHere’s what we changed:\n\n1. Lead with an emotional benefit: The original copy started with product specs. I replaced that first line with a benefit-driven statement: “Achieve gym-quality results at home – feel the burn, minus the commute.” – Immediately tells the customer what’s in it for them (convenience + results).\n\n2. Sprinkle in sensory and power words: We added words like “sculpt”, “exclusive program”, “effortless 15-minute routines” to make it more vivid and appealing. Language that evokes feeling &gt; dry facts.\n\n3. Added social proof: Worked in a one-liner testimonial from a beta user: “Surpassed my expectations – my go-to daily workout now.” This builds trust.\n\n4. Clear CTA: The original description kind of just… ended. We added a gentle nudge: “Ready to transform? Get your kit today and start your journey!” – sometimes people need to be told to take action.\n\n5. Format for readability: Broke a long wall of text into bullet points highlighting key benefits (fast setup, all-in-one kit, etc.). Easier to read = more likely to be read.\n\nBonus: I actually used an AI prompt tool I built (if you’re curious: it’s a Notion library of writing prompts) to generate some copy variations and cherry-picked the best phrases. Really sped things up.\n\nResults: Conversion rate on the listing went from ~8% to ~11% within a week of the new copy (the client has consistent traffic volume, so it was a noticeable lift). The product also got a couple of new reviews mentioning “description was accurate” which was nice validation.\n\nTakeaway: Don’t sleep on your product descriptions! A few copy tweaks – especially focusing on benefits, emotional triggers, and social proof – can make a tangible difference in sales. If anyone’s interested in the prompt I used for the AI or wants me to critique their product copy, let me know in the comments. Happy to help a fellow marketer out.\n\n🙂\nWhat do you think?

I really want things to be civil but it feels like they&amp;#39;re pretty entitled and do whatever they can get away with, and I&amp;#39;m worried that if I address it as sternly as I need to to get the point across, they&amp;#39;ll get passive aggressive or retaliate in some way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m genuinely at a loss as to how to deal with these folks and I&amp;#39;m not sure what the best move is, I have a nice shop there and I&amp;#39;m about to have my home there and don&amp;#39;t care to have people or obnoxious banners appearing at random on my balcony. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d rather handle it myself and not have to have my landlord step in as I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the best way to develop a peaceful, respectful relationship with the new neighbors, but I will if I have to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tldr: new tenants won&amp;#39;t respect my space and they keep climbing my roof to get into my balcony&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"psyducker8","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nkmfh2/new_business_neighbors_keep_climbing_on_my_roof/","domain":"self.smallbusiness","score":11,"num_comments":23,"created_utc":1758234524,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nklzv8","subreddit":"smallbusiness","title":"SBA Loan Approval Chances","selftext":"So I'm looking to franchise a coffee shop to another city in texas. \n\nBetween my partners and I, long story short but i'm looking to gaurentee the loan myself.\n\n150k in liquid capital\n\n500k term life insurance \n\n735 credit score and a steady income of 85k/year\n\nI'm trying to get an SBA loan for about 400k, Its an existing franchise thats been around since 2008 but hasn't ventured into other cities yet and I'm trying to be their first franchisee in a new city.

Don’t get me wrong, I still have input in the content I do through my guy because he always incorporates parts of my story, skills etc. and even leaves room for me to say things in my own words, but idk maybe I feel like the 3x growth is not because of me? Or maybe I’m a bit overwhelmed by it all.

Here’s How Fiber Lasers Are Helping Small Businesses","selftext":"In the laser processing world, not everyone has the same needs.\n\n* DIY users often just want a compact, easy-to-use engraver.\n* Small and medium-sized manufacturers, on the other hand, usually need tailored solutions for batch production, specific materials, or even workflow integration.\n\nThat’s where “custom solutions” come in—and they’ve basically become a benchmark of how strong a manufacturer really is.\n\nRecently, I looked into how Cloudray approaches this. They’ve built a full ecosystem around customization, and here are some highlights that stood out to me:\n\n# 1. Full Product Ecosystem\n\nThey cover everything from accessories to machines to services. Two fiber lasers—the **MP-60 NEO** and **GM-100 NEO**—act as the core platforms because of their modular design and scalability. On top of that, their **UV-P-5 UV engraver** and **EC Series CO₂ engravers** extend into more specialized materials and applications.\n\n# 2. Technical Strengths\n\n* **Precision:** ±0.1 µm positioning accuracy.\n* **Speed:** 15,000 mm/s engraving.\n* **Durability:** 24/7 operation, 100,000-hour lifespan.\n* **Flexibility:** Split-type design makes maintenance and reconfiguration simple.\n\nFor example:\n\n* In jewelry, they can integrate a D80 rotary axis for ring engraving.\n* In batch metal parts, the work area can expand up to **1000 × 300 mm** (7.5× standard).\n\n# 3. Functional Customization\n\n* **Personalized Marking:** 100+ color markings on metals (great for jewelry &amp; gifts).\n* **Precision Positioning:** Built-in 8MP HD camera + autofocus, 0.01 mm accuracy (helpful for electronics).\n* **3D/Glass Engraving:** UV-P-5 handles 3D, internal, and surface engraving with a 0.04 mm spot size.\n* **High-Speed Non-Metals:** EC Series CO₂ runs at **10,000 mm/s**, far faster than standard CO₂ (500–800 mm/s).\n\nBoth MP-60 NEO and GM-100 NEO support **Ezcad and Lightburn** with up to 256 layers.\n\n# 4. Material Compatibility (2,000+ materials)\n\n* **UV lasers:** plastics, heat-sensitive substrates, reflective metals (gold/silver/copper).\n* **Fiber lasers:** alloys, thin sheet metals.\n* **CO₂ lasers:** wood, acrylic, leather, ceramics, paper, etc.\n\n# 5. Lifecycle Service\n\n* **Global warehouses** → fast delivery.\n* **24×5 online support** \\+ local service teams.\n* **Industry-specific guidance** for unique needs.\n\n# 6. Big Picture\n\nCloudray says their vision is “Breaking Down Barriers to Laser Applications.” They’re in 100+ countries now, serving both consumers (DIY, personalized gifts, jewelry) and industries (metal, electronics, packaging, printing).\n\n**My takeaway:**  \nFor small businesses, the interesting part isn’t just the hardware—it’s the ability to customize solutions for batch production, material variety, and industry-specific workflows.\n\n👉 Has anyone here tried customizing laser setups for small business use (like jewelry, packaging, or electronics)?

My business is ecom/dropship but there was previously a retail presence which I got rid of to spend more time with my growing family. \n\n  \nI have a product that my business is the biggest seller of in the United States, and we have exclusive pricing with our distributor for. This product, like nearly every product in the automotive space, is made in China. We had some major complications with inventory during COVID. Ever since then there have been minor steps made to shift to USA production. When Trump got re-elected the decision was officially made despite not being 100% ready for the move. This year from Jan-March I was down to selling C/D tier SKUs because a lot of the main stuff was running out due to not reordering from China. It was all supposed to work out though to pick back up in March/April for the USA made units to hit. Well, as anything would go, there were some issues with the process which have since been ironed out, but it meant that the March/April timeline didn't work out. So from April through the end of July I didn't have shit to sell so I just took it as a little break with the family. Some units started arriving in late July but things are just now getting going again. However, it will probably be the end of the year before inventory is where it needs to be to be rolling good again. \n\n  \nMy profit after add-backs for 2023- 373K\n\nMy profit after add-backs for 2024- 434K\n\nMy profit after add-backs for TTM- 273K\n\n  \n(Numbers are varying a little as we are still working through the add-backs)\n\n  \nQuiet Light is wanting to do a 2x valuation for TTM. So around 550k sale\n\nWebsite Closers is wanting to do a 2-3x valuation on 2024. So around 1m, but they say that it will probably take an earn out, seller financing, or some other incentive to get this valuation of 1m, and a sale of around 500-750 is more likely. \n\nLatonas is wanting to do 4x valuation for TTM. So around 1.15m sale\n\n  \nMy personal thoughts, Quiet Light seems more about getting it sold and getting it sold quickly. I would hope it would sell for 550k pretty fast and easy, but I don't really want to go that low on it. I would like to get as close to 1m as possible and I am aware that I need to get sales back up but the guy at Latonas made a great point. I have been in business for 7 years and done a lot to the business. I have carved out a place in my industry that is sort of my own with my exclusive pricing, and with the manufacturing moving to the USA I have solved a big problem for the future of the business. So should I really be punished for bead sales during a necessary transition period? One that many competitors have not made and will be way behind on. I also spent 2024 getting rid of the retail store, getting rid of bigger expenses, and making the business pretty hands off. There are still customer service and sales aspects I have to do on a daily basis but as much of the business is automated as can be. I was working 10-12 hours 6 days a week in 2023 and in 2024 I was working 2-4 hour days 5 days a week. So it has gone from a 60-72 hour a week job, to a 10-20 hour a week business. \n\n  \nI get that the smart thing to do would be to wait and rebound sales and then list it, but I decided to sell the business back in March/April when all this started occurring. I ran my business through COVID and countless other hurtles and I am tired of the stress and mental strain that comes with a business. I have a 2 year old and a 2 month old and I want to just take the next few years off to spend with them until they go off to grade school. I am just tired and I know it is not the ideal time to sell but it is the right time for me to sell for personal reasons. I am not selling it to get rid of the work because I have some billion dollar new venture. I am selling it to fund a few years off, so I need to get as much for it as I can to not only afford to live but also try to mentally and emotionally justify getting rid of my \"baby\" of 7 years. \n\n  \nSo others that have sold through this tariff dip or in similar situations, how did that affect your sale, what did you do, and where are you now? Also open to any and all brokers that can get me a sale for as much as possible without it taking a year to happen? \n\n  \nI am really needing guidance here because signing with any of them means a 3-6 month commitment and I don't want to have to deal with a bunch of tales or double commissions. I want to pick the right broker the first time but I also don't want to settle for a lower valuation just because of a bad year due to some manufacturing changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Been in business for a little over 7 years in the Automotive space.

This is really long-winded so I doubt people will read but it’s good to get it off my chest because I feel like I’m absolutely drowning right now. \n\nWithout giving so much detail as to remain anonymous, basically my husband has sunk 13 years into his career path and we are financially stable, have our house paid off and live within our means with no outstanding debt. \n\nJob stress is low for both of us as of now, so we are able to spend more time together and have actual intimacy. It’s been great, the stress and backbreaking hours he went through (and I also went through, facing the brunt of not having a lot of intimacy, time or in-depth conversations with him due to all his stress he was taking on) have been worth it because of what we have now. I work a minimum wage job so I’m obviously not the bread winner, but I like to add a bit of cushion to our budget. \n\nHis parents have been great, very generous and loving and have helped us a lot, but it’s never gotten to the point that we relied on them heavily financially, so the relationship is balanced. I will say they are very anxious and over-prepare for nearly everything so it can be intense sometimes. They are also from a different country, so there’s a lot of ‘unspoken’ expectations and I’ve had to really talk to them and let them know they have to communicate and not assume I know things going forward. They have listened to that, and would communicate better with me and boundaries were respected. I also know there is a cultural difference so I was and am patient as well. Overall, relationship is good. \n\nSo 2 days ago, his dad dropped a bombshell at dinner. He speaks another language dominantly, so I was trying to understand him the best I could (I have somewhat learned the language to be able to understand when it’s spoken) my husband was talking with him in the language, so he wasn’t able to translate the conversation immediately. I was a bit panicked initially and felt just that big ‘red flag’ feeling and it was really hard to push it down at the dinner. I did not have a great reaction and my husband recalls being surprised by my reaction. 😓\n\nSo his dad wants to give him ownership of half the business and was explaining that the responsibilities would be very low, and would not interfere with my husbands current career he worked so hard for. After taxes and all that, he told us that we would approx. receive around 200k at the end of 2026, as the business is doing very well and has expanded. \n\nWithout disclosing too much but explaining why that is the case, in terms of not receiving the 200k till Dec 2026, basically how it works is that the money received from jobs are used to pay for other jobs, as we can’t rely on companies to pay us fast enough to cover every dime before starting a next job. The job is surveying properties and estimating the type of work needed, so lots of traveling to different places, booking stays and flights, sending people out, filing invoices and writing checks, etc. \n\nI feel that his father is a very trustworthy person in all the years I’ve known him. However, he also has ungodly timing for things. Often he will call my husband to book or check something (he’s been doing this for years, not since being asked to become a 51% owner of the company) and it can get frustrating bc my husband has said that he ‘feels like he is being pulled in 10 different directions’ when we get into fights over him not being emotionally available for me. \n\nMy husband is very loving and gentle, patient and kind. He also tends to hyper-focus on things as well though, and doesn’t initiate anything remotely romantic. I have to ask him to buy me flowers for my birthday and take me out for our anniversary, things like that, he doesn’t come up with it on his own, ever. But the thing is he’s glad to provide and do anything I think of, he does it agreeably and never gets an attitude over anything if I want something. He is endlessly generous to me and is very physically touchy, physical attraction between us is not an issue, but I have to constantly ask for what I need and want, he doesn’t come up with something by himself. \n\nWith me he is playful and silly, completely relaxes. He is very different around his parents, which is understandable, I can also turn into an annoyed teenager around mine. He gets irritable when he’s around them, and sometimes to the point that he can be cold to me as well around his parents, he will counter me sometimes in conversation, his mom is a high anxiety person and I think he gets very emotionally drained being around his parents for long periods of time. \n\nThey are nice but also very controlling of how things ‘go’ if that makes sense. I didn’t even notice this until a few years ago that he was so emotionally stressed by his parents, bc we would travel and do fun things with his parents together and I would always wonder why he didn’t appear to be enjoying himself as much as I was. I would relax and have fun with his parents, but he would look bored and cold and not be having fun 70% of the time I would say. \n\nThis is really long at this point but I am struggling so much because my husband is pouncing on this, signing the paperwork today and I just have such a bad feeling in my gut. I feel like the stress of working with his father will drive him up the wall, but he assures me that having this much income would be stressful at any career. I admit that’s true, more money more problems either way, but I’m just worried about the impact this will have on my marriage. I asked him to get everything in writing with his dad, to get ALL the responsibilities and time written down that would be expected of him and to establish boundaries. He hasn’t done that yet, and he said that felt ‘wrong’ and bad. I told him that’s what it’s like to make boundaries with people you love, but that it protects both parties in the end. \n\nAs his wife I don’t have much say in how this all falls into place, soooo am I just totally overreacting and reaching bc I feel anxiety from lack of control in this situation? My husband basically said the money is too good to pass up, and that he fully believes it will be more of a figurehead type of job. I don’t think his dad would lie to us, but I do think his dad wants to keep the business going and have control and the way to do that is to attach his only son to the business. Sigh \n\nI feel so helpless, of course I know the money is good but we wouldn’t see it for 16 months, take on more stress, and I just feel the dynamic is shifting way too fast. I feel nervous about it.

However, my wife at the time convinced me to shut it down because I spent ALL my time running that business and she wanted me to get a 9-5 job. So I became Security Director for an international electronics manufacturing company until I moved to Florida, where I became Security Director for a condo association. I also co-founded a Florida Security Academy, and we cornered the market right after COVID passed over, and we made decent money. That is, until Florida passed a law that allows academies to conduct online training - at which time we were competing against larger state and national academies. My partner and I could not agree on a single direction to take the company, so we are shutting it down, effective this December. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year (June 2025) I started my second security company, this time in Florida (which is much more regulated and expensive to get started). I saved up the money to get started, and enough for labor for 2 months if I was to get a full 24/7 contract. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I let my business partner at the Academy convince me to work with another company that is essentially a security services brokerage, which requires a LOT more insurance than the state minimum, but I went with it, hoping to make my money back quickly. It was a big mistake and I lost thousands of dollars, and basically drained my account dry with no return. Now, I couldn&amp;#39;t staff a new contract if one dropped in my lap. But more importantly, I&amp;#39;m not getting ANY calls for service!! I&amp;#39;ve placed the business on hold to save up money again, but I&amp;#39;m curious -- what am I missing??

Everything feels controversial nowadays 2. There are actually causes that are “controversial” but are related to my business, but I choose to not talk about them because people are cancel-crazy 3. For better or worse, being a little controversial on social media is so good for gaining an audience, so I feel like I’m keeping my accounts from growing by being so moderate/not engaging\n\nI feel very conflicted and I need some small business advice. \n\nBecause of where I live, my customer demographic, and the type of business I have, my customer’s beliefs and politics lean a certain way and those people feel REALLY comfortable dumping their politics on me and the main problem is that I genuinely like these people, but we have literally opposite politics.\n\nIt sucks to just sit there behind a counter and shake my head with a dead stare aimlessly at someone talking to me as if I agree with them.

I responded to let her know that because I had already delivered the content calendar, strategy and one post had gone out for that cycle that I could not offer a full refund but offered to give her a refund for the services she hadn’t received yet and she obviously could keep the content calendar and strategy (the post was already posted which she approved manually by the way.) \n\nShe did not like this response, she immediately clapped back saying I put her in the hospital due to multiple panic attacks and her doctor and psychiatrist suggested she end the relationship. She also stated that all of my work was aweful and not satisfactory so she deserved a refund (again I have photo proof of the positive feedback she was giving.)

He got OSHA and HVAC certified, and is even commercially certified (his dad is only residential). Despite this, he’s only ever been paid in cash. He didn’t file taxes until 2024 because he had to start setting aside 30% himself when his dad wouldn't legitimize his employment, even after multiple conversations saying he would. This caused major issues for us when applying for rentals or trying to get a car. It has since been resolved and we have disscussed the issues with his dad.\n\n**Pay history:**\n\n* 18–20 years old: $500/week cash.\n* At 21: raised to $600/week.\n* Early 2025: $1,000/week (he puts aside $300, so take-home $700). This only happened after he threatened to leave.\n* No benefits, no health insurance (his dad just gives him cash for medical bills), and no retirement plan. He recently opened his own Roth IRA and is putting $ aside himself.\n\nHe’s been offered jobs at larger HVAC companies ($35–45/hr + benefits), but has stayed out of loyalty and it being his dream to run his family business one day.\n\nWe have lived in his old family home since January of this year (it's a mobile home that his dad did not take very good care of, and we have put a lot of money into trying to fix it, but it hasn't helped a ton). His dad allowed one of his old friends to rent the house from him for almost a decade and he basically destroyed it, and his dad never said anything to the guy about it. I'm talking there were flea and other bug infestations, the floor was caving in, the bathrooms were completely unusable, it was bad. His dad and his wife \"helped\" us clean it up enough to move in, but the rest was on us to clean and fix.\n\nWe have since been presented with an opportunity to move to a nicer place. My mom is moving and she has a nice rental property a few towns over that is fairly cheap, nice landlord and neighbors, big yard for our new puppy, closer to family, and only $1,000/month after utilities. He and I have discussed moving before, but we live near a college town (I work there and go to school there), so rent is ridiculous and hard to find places for.\n\nBusiness background: The HVAC business started in 1985 with his grandpa, kind of informally to just make some extra side money. His dad took it over full-time about 10 years ago and has built a pretty solid clientele base. He has to turn down work because of how many people want their work. Although their family is very well known because of his grandparents so that probably helps a lot. They do very good and honest work, so that isn't a concern at all. They honestly should charge more than they do. It's just him and my husband working together. He has been telling my husband, \"I want you to eventually run your own crew,\" \"I want to get you a work van like mine so you can do jobs by yourself,\" etc for the past two years. He is basically always telling him things like this and how he wants the business to progress, but never actually takes any action to do so. His dad just has one bank account that he puts all the business profits into and doesn't separate personal from business funds. He also has his wife, with no background in tax filing, do his taxes every year. He doesn't pay quarterly taxes because he \"doesn't know how,\" so he always pays an insane amount during tax season. He also doesn't write anything off for the same reason. Even my husband who is still learning to do taxes himself, knows how to do these things. His dad doesn't even have a retirement account for himself or his own health insurance, he just uses his wife's insurance through her work and I assume is planning on retiring when she does and drawing social security. He has told my husband that on average the last 5 years he makes around $150,000/yr. He files as a sole proprietor; the business isn't under an LLC or anything, and he doesn't have any sort of protection if he were to get sued or something.\n\nThe issue:  \nMy husband just started school for entrepreneurial and business accounting certificates. He wants to modernize and formalize the business. I’ve been helping with research, reading on LLCs, accounting programs, and labor laws. Together we drafted a business proposal and operating agreement.\n\nWe showed it to his dad yesterday. He said it looked good, but wanted his wife to review it first. We’re sitting down with them tonight to discuss. My concern is that he’ll either refuse or agree in the moment but backtrack later (especially since his wife heavily influences his decisions, and he enjoys the current setup where business/personal funds are all mixed).\n\nHere is a very broad summary of what my husband and I have come up with for the proposal and operating agreement:\n\nThe plan is to form an LLC effective January 1, 2026, to avoid interfering with 2025 tax stuff. Leading up to the launch, there are monthly action steps that my husband will be taking in additon to his full-time field work and school work:\n\n* **LLC Setup**: File with the state, sign the operating agreement, and open business accounts (checking, savings, and credit).\n* **Financial Prep**: Build a 2026 budget forecast, set up QuickBooks, and research financing options.\n* **Operations &amp; Training**: His dad continues working full-time in the field while the my husband handles both fieldwork and administrative/marketing tasks, with the goal of being trained to run estimates and eventually jobs independently.\n* **Marketing**: Relaunch social media, post photos/testimonials, and boost ads.\n* **Office Space**: Scout rental options and decide whether to lease just office space or space with a shop attached by January.\n* **Stipends**: My husband receives a temporary $1,000 monthly stipend for the heavy administrative load until the LLC formally launches in January in additon to his weekly field pay.\n\n**Operating Agreement Highlights**\n\n* **Ownership**: 50/50 split between two members, both actively managing.\n* **Contributions**: His dad provides equipment/initial funding; my husband provides labor, admin duties, and business systems setup.\n* **Profits/Distributions**: Split evenly; no personal accounts may be used for business funds.\n* **Decision-Making**: Day-to-day decisions can be made by either, but major decisions (hiring, debt over $5k, equipment purchases, leases, dissolution, etc.) require unanimous approval. Deadlocks go to mediation.\n* **Transfer Rules**: Ownership cannot be sold/transferred to outsiders without unanimous approval. If one exits, the other has first right to buy their share.\n* **Death/Disability**: Ownership passes to spouse, with structured buyout options for the surviving member.\n* **Finances**: All income must go into company accounts. Business expenses must be paid from company funds. Credit cards must be paid in full monthly.\n* **Dissolution**: Assets split evenly unless misconduct is involved, in which case the innocent party gets 75%.\n* **Insurance**: Business must carry liability, vehicle, and key-person life insurance. Health insurance must be provided for both members and their families.\n* **Retirement**: Each member is responsible for their own retirement unless they agree later to set up a joint plan.\n\nWe are sitting down with his dad and stepmom tonight to discuss this. I am in need of any advice or warnings. Should we just cut our losses and have him go work for another company? It has always been his dream to further his family's business and I know it would crush him to give that up, but he is also not willing to be strung along by his dad anymore.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, this is going to be long one, but we&amp;#39;re in desperate need of some harsh and realisitc advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backstory:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nMy husband (22M) has been working for his dad’s HVAC business since he was 14, and went full-time right after high school when he was 18.

If one exits, the other has first right to buy their share.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Death/Disability&lt;/strong&gt;: Ownership passes to spouse, with structured buyout options for the surviving member.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finances&lt;/strong&gt;: All income must go into company accounts. Business expenses must be paid from company funds. Credit cards must be paid in full monthly.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dissolution&lt;/strong&gt;: Assets split evenly unless misconduct is involved, in which case the innocent party gets 75%.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insurance&lt;/strong&gt;: Business must carry liability, vehicle, and key-person life insurance. Health insurance must be provided for both members and their families.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retirement&lt;/strong&gt;: Each member is responsible for their own retirement unless they agree later to set up a joint plan.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are sitting down with his dad and stepmom tonight to discuss this.

I bought in for $50k (20%). The CEO took 29%, and the majority partner held 51% with an SBA loan of $350k. I pushed for a smaller, affordable space, but the others insisted on a 4,000 sq. ft. office. I deferred to their experience.\n* **2022–2023:** We opened in early 2022. Growth was slow but steady. By 2023 we were profitable. I focused on marketing and treating clients, while my partners handled billing and admin. Things felt balanced.\n* **Early 2024:** Red flags appeared. I discovered unauthorized equipment purchases and misuse of company funds. An audit revealed the majority partner had misappropriated about $400k for personal expenses. They agreed to repay, and the CEO and I took over the clinic. But in retaliation, the majority partner poached all our employees, destabilizing operations.\n* **2024–2025:** The CEO promised to rebuild with a new team—but never delivered. Over the next year, the clinic bled money. I repeatedly urged the CEO to relocate to a smaller, more affordable space, but he ignored me. By early 2025, the situation was dire.\n\n**Eviction:**  \nI had a good relationship with the landlord and spoke with them directly. They admitted they were open to negotiating an exit, but the CEO kept brushing them off and even threatened lawsuits, which soured the relationship further. Eventually, the rent default caught up with us, and the eviction happened.\n\n**Where things stand now:**\n\n* \\-$62k in credit card debt\n* $20k in unpaid rent\n* Potential $90k lease penalty\n\nThe landlord’s lawyer has suggested they may release me personally since I’ve been transparent with them and they know I wasn’t the one running things into the ground.\n\nAt this point, I want out of this poorly managed company. I’m even prepared to file bankruptcy if necessary. My main concern: can the CEO actually come after me for anything if I walk away?
