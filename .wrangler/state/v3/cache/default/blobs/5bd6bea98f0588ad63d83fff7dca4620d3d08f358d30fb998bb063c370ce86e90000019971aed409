I wanted to find out if that’s just perception or something you can actually measure, so i wired up a harness that runs the same coding/debugging tasks across multiple providers on a schedule and tracks how they drift.\n\nThe hard part wasn’t the charts, it was making the tests fair and repeatable. I ended up using small, unit-testable Python tasks, salting prompts to avoid provider-side caching, running the generated code in a sandbox with time/memory limits, and taking medians over a few trials to dampen noise. Scores are broken down by correctness, code quality signals, efficiency/latency, stability (variance across trials), and a couple of “did it fall on its face?” axes for refusals and brittle fixes. There’s also a historical baseline so a model that suddenly “feels different” shows up as an actual deviation instead of vibes.\n\nIt’s open source and free i’m not selling anything and there are no ads. I honestly built it to sanity-check my own workflow, but it ended up getting way more traffic in the first week than i expected, which tells me a lot of devs are running into the same thing.\n\nIf you want to kick the tires or critique the methodology, I’d love feedback.

Probably the most annoying one is when they upend meetings with the following:\n\n\"Hey guys, I know you are saying that the scope is practically impossible, but I just asked perplexity and it found 2 research papers in 30 seconds, so it is possible and we will move forward with implementing them\"\n\nAnd this would be in the middle of a room of SMEs that just described how difficult to impossible the task is for one of my sub teams.  Taking beyond a 30 second look at these research papers would tell anyone that  they didn't fit our scope or solve the issues we had, and reimplementing them into something that is actually production ready is not going to be as easy as he always seems to think.\n\nI won't go into my job or how it operates, and let me preface this, I don't have the time or support infrastructure in place to make proper production applications, let alone MVPs. Yet as of recently, my core team has been(in addition to our other responsibilities) responsible for taking my sub team's code and hack job productionizing them, with the sub teams being told they essentially need to make MVPs when they don't have the skill, know how, or time just because my boss writes checks with his mouth he can't deliver. I can't explain what we can do to solve it without revealing who we are, but take my word that it's almost impossible.\n\nFor a totally separate client, we had a 3rd party team that I interfaced with make a PoC for a client, and based off the client feedback it was okay at the end of the contract. The client comes back 3 months later complaining that the PoC has too many bugs and things he doesn't like about it to show and shop around. So my boss sits me down and says I need to take it and fix it. I tell him that it was just a PoC and we don't have time to re-write this additional codebase. So guess who has to find time to make this codebase a priority and make it more MVP like :). \n\nI looked at the codebase and it's total AI slop, just piecemealed together to get something working. I told my boss and client that we would need to re-write the entire backend instead of Frankensteining it more to get it working, which will take a few months with all of our other priorities. My boss says \"just use AI, you will get it done in a week or so!\" In front of the client 🙃. He then starts to push onto the client how we could revamp the UI and add all of these UI changes. I explain that due to them using the framework they did, anything beyond simple changes would necessitate a full re-write in a real UI framework. I get told back \"have you heard of Vercel V0, Lovable, etc.... just use one of those and you will get a fully functional UI in minutes, so I'm not worried about scope creep.\" This man has never touched a code base in his life, never made an app/website with code, but yet he is lecturing me on how AI can just do it for us 😁.This is not even taking into account it needs to be in a MVP stage which is beyond what we originally were contracted to do.\n\nWhen I read the article, it triggered me and gave me these flashbacks. I don't know if I'm being too stubborn/close minded, but I think that AI is going to enable more people to think it's just that easy and let them lecture real programmers who knows how hard it is.","author":"aaaafireball","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nnjyoq/would_you_be_annoyed_if_your_boss_used_ai_to/","domain":"futurism.com","score":172,"num_comments":66,"created_utc":1758540724,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnjus2","subreddit":"programming","title":"undertale for xbox360","selftext":"i want to port undertale for the xbox360,i want to publish it too but the person who wants to play has to get the data.win file and put it in the files of the game so no piracy,\n\ni have zero idea on how to port undertale for the 360, i just know they have to mod their console to play and that i can make it in visual studio 2010 with the xbox360 sdk\n\nif anyone is down to do this project hit me up lol.","author":"ConsciousStill9476","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nnjus2/undertale_for_xbox360/","domain":"neog.neocities.org","score":0,"num_comments":0,"created_utc":1758540376,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnhnk0","subreddit":"programming","title":"Building Conway’s Game of Life in Go with raylib-go","selftext":"","author":"der_gopher","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nnhnk0/building_conways_game_of_life_in_go_with_raylibgo/","domain":"packagemain.tech","score":1,"num_comments":0,"created_utc":1758532631,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnh0ng","subreddit":"programming","title":"Clean code = Happy teams!

No course, no coaching, no agency pitch. **I don't want your money**.\n\nI'm just a guy building Marz (a fully-automated creator platform) who's sick of watching startups torch cash on ads and manual influencer outreach. This is the exact workflow we're using right now to spin up hundreds of creator posts in days and beat paid ads on CAC—steal it.\n\nAll I ask: **try it, then come back and drop your tweaks/results in the comments.**\n\n# The 3-step playbook 👇\n\n**Step 1. Feed the machine the right inputs.**\n\nTraditional approach = scrape CreatorLookup, cold-email 20K leads, pray.\nMarz flips that:\n\n1. Pick your product, geo, and budget inside the dashboard (takes ~3 min).\n2. Our engine auto-pulls **10K–15K qualified micro-creators** (&lt;150 K followers, &gt;5 K avg views, niche match) from IG/TikTok/YouTube.\n3. Dynamic outreach goes out under your brand domain—sequences are auto-personalized (name + niche) and drive creators to a self-serve join link.\n\n👉 Result: we consistently see **45–55 % open, 20 % reply, 8–12 % onboard** with zero human chase. Your only \"manual\" work is approving the creative brief if you want to (optional).\n\n**Step 2. Let programmatic deals do the negotiating for you.**\n\nOld way = back-and-forth DMs, PDF contracts, Net-30.\nNew way:\n\n1. Creator hits the join link → autofills social handles, contact, payout method.\n2. Marz fires back a dynamic CPM offer (usually $1.80–$2.50) based on their historic RPM.\n3. Contract + escrow payment auto-generate via Stripe Connect; creator can see exactly how much they'll earn **per 1 K views**.\n4. AI spits out a brief + 3 hook options; creator records → uploads.\n5. Optional draft approval (brands that skip this go live 24 h faster and see better creative).\n\nEnd of month, Marz pulls first-party analytics straight from the platform APIs, releases payouts, and reconciles your budget—no chasing screenshots.\n\n👉 Net result: **&lt;60 seconds of brand labor per creator**, scalable to 500+ creators without adding headcount.\n\n**Step 3. The numbers that matter.**\n\nLast 30-day sprint (B2C subscription app):\n\n* 412 approved creators, 387 went live within 5 days.\n* 14.7 M tracked views, 126 K clicks to App Store.\n* **eCAC $18.40** vs. $50.10 on Meta Ads (-63 %).\n* **$1.92 blended CPM** after Marz fees (there are none) + creator payouts.\n* 9 creators smashed 1 M views each; we cap payouts at 3 M so extra impressions were free → effective campaign CPM dropped to **$1.31**.\n\nWe paused the bottom 70 % performers in Marz with one click, kept the top 30 %, and re-filled the pipeline with 300 fresh creators—compounding reach each cycle.\n\n# Why it works\n\n1. **Volume beats \"perfect.\"** Programmatic sourcing means you never run out of talent.\n2. **Aligned incentives.** CPM pricing rewards heavy hitters and quietly weeds out the rest.\n3. **Speed = learning.** Five-day feedback loops let you iterate offers/creatives faster than paid ads stuck in review.\n4. **Trust via escrow.** Creators get instant payouts; brands never pre-pay for content that doesn't ship.\n\n# Steal this today\n\nYou don't need 400 creators out of the gate. Spin up a $2 K test budget, target 50 micro-creators, and watch what happens. Cut the dead weight, double down on the winners, repeat.\n\nInfluencer marketing doesn't have to be spreadsheets and prayers. Turn it into code, let the machine run, and go build product instead.\n\n— Tomas\n\nP.S. If you try any twist on this—different niches, CPL instead of CPM, seed-stage budgets—**drop the data below**.

Seriously, my Twitter feed was full of people showing off their fancy workflows while I was still using almost no automation.  \nTherefore I started to learn &amp; automate small tasks.\n\n**My First Attempts Were Messy**\n\nI was using coding tools like [V0 ](https://v0.app/)and [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code). They're cool for building stuff, but they didn't solve my daily grunt work. I was still drowning in emails, forgetting meetings, and spending hours on boring tasks.\n\nThen I tried [n8n](https://n8n.io/) . Everyone said it was amazing. And yeah, if you know how to code, you can figure it out. But man, it felt like building a rocket ship just to make toast. Every simple thing needed multiple steps, connections, and constant tweaking when something broke.\n\nI spent more time fixing my automations than actually working.\n\n# What Actually Worked\n\nThat's when I discovered prompt-based tools. Instead of connecting boxes and writing code, I could just tell the AI what I wanted in normal English.\n\nI started using [BhindiAI ](https://bhindi.io/)for my daily stuff:\n\n* Sorting through emails and writing replies\n* Setting up meetings without the back-and-forth\n* Updating my project tasks automatically\n* Following up with people who went quiet\n\nFor my side projects, Clay AI became a game-changer. It finds potential customers for me and gives me their info plus what to talk to them about. No more spending weekends researching leads.\n\n# Other Tools That Actually Help\n\nHere's what I use now for different things:\n\n**For repetitive computer stuff:** I use [Zapier ](https://zapier.com/)for simple connections (way easier than n8n) and Shortcuts on Mac for things like file organizing and quick calculations.\n\n**For content:** I have ChatGPT write first drafts of emails, social posts, and even help brainstorm project ideas. Notion AI helps me clean up my messy notes.\n\n**For scheduling:** Calendly handles meeting bookings, and I use Reclaim.ai to automatically block time for focused work.\n\n**For research:** Perplexity is like having a research assistant. I ask it to find information about competitors, market trends, or technical solutions.\n\n**For social media:** Buffer schedules my posts across platforms, and I use Canva's AI to create quick graphics without spending hours in Photoshop.\n\n**What People Get Wrong**\n\nMost people try to automate everything at once. That's backwards.\n\nStart small. Pick one annoying thing you do every day and automate just that. For me, it was email replies. Once that worked, I moved to the next thing.\n\nAlso, don't automate broken processes. If something is messy when you do it manually, automation will just make it messier faster.\n\nAnd honestly? Sometimes the \"automation\" is just using a better tool. I switched from complex project management apps to simple ones that actually work for how my brain operates.\n\n# The Real Change\n\nI'm not saying I never do manual work now. But the difference is huge. I used to start each day with a list of boring tasks. Now I start thinking about what I actually want to build.\n\nMy brain isn't constantly interrupted by \"oh, I need to email that person back\" or \"did I update that spreadsheet?\" Those things just happen in the background.\n\nThe best part? Most of these tools are either free or cost less than a coffee subscription. You don't need to be a tech wizard or spend thousands on fancy software.\n\nJust start with one annoying task and make it go away. Then move to the next one.\n\n","author":"Valuable_Simple3860","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nnmamd/ive_automated_50_tasks_heres_what_everyone_gets/","domain":"self.SaaS","score":3,"num_comments":3,"created_utc":1758547198,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnm809","subreddit":"SaaS","title":"I built a little side project last week to scratch an itch, and it kind of blew up.

I saw friends filling out aptitude tests that told them they should be “engineers” or “accountants,” but when they actually tried those paths, they realized it didn’t feel right. On the other hand, some people just guessed, jumped into a career, and only years later figured out they weren’t happy. That gap between what we’re told to do and what it actually feels like to do it is huge. So I built this platform. It’s still a scrappy MVP, but the idea is simple:  \nInstead of just reading about a career or taking a test, you actually try out short, hands-on tasks from different jobs. Like taking a tiny test drive before buying the car. This way, you don’t have to wait until it’s “too late” to discover if you enjoy the work.

I have monthly revenue north of 20k USD per month.\n\nToday I'm splitting it in two.\n\nSports scoreboards stay at KeepTheScore.com. Everything else moves to **[Leaderboarded.com](https://leaderboarded.com)**.\n\n## Some background: what 2025 taught me\n\nEarlier this year, I introduced a bug that broke a crucial part of the user experience and tanked my revenue. It took \n**5 months** to find and fix — a rough period I'll detail next time. The good news: revenue is growing again. 🥳\n\nThis disaster forced me to face the real problem: I was serving two completely different user groups with one product.\n\nSports users needed digital scoreboards for games and streaming overlays. Teachers, managers, and event organizers\nneeded leaderboards for classroom behavior, sales competitions, and fundraising. Two different products crammed into\none.\n\nThis caused a number of problems:\n\n* Unclear and confused messaging and marketing\n* SEO problems with various landing pages competing for keywords\n* Difficulties finding a pricing model and value metrics that fit both products\n* Muddy metrics, unclear user segments, all users smooshed together in one pot\n* It was hard to write clear documentation and FAQs for the product\n\n\n## The Bad\n\nThe risks are real:\n\n**1. Revenue impact.** Teachers might not trust a brand-new \"Leaderboarded.com\" without the thousands of reviews\nKeepTheScore has accumulated.\n\n**2. SEO challenges.** Years of domain authority gone. Starting fresh means months to rebuild rankings and competing\nagainst my own established site.\n\n**3. Double the maintenance.** Two domains, two blogs, two marketing strategies.\n\n**4. User confusion.** Some existing users won't understand why there are suddenly two sites.\n\n## The Good\n\nBut the benefits outweigh the risks:\n\n**1. Clean metrics.** I'll finally know which user group is struggling when conversions drop.\n\n**2. Focused product development.** Each product can serve its audience without compromise.\n\n**3. Clear marketing.** No more trying to sell the same thing to basketball coaches and elementary teachers.\n\n**4. Better pricing.** Finally, packages that make sense for each group.\n\n## How I built this in 10 days\n\nA few months ago, before I'd even considered splitting the product, I got lucky. A competitor was shutting down and I managed to acquire their domain — leaderboarded.com — for a reasonable price. This turned out to be perfect timing. The domain already had SEO value since search engines recognized it as being related to leaderboards, giving me a head start rather than starting from scratch.\n\nThis entire split — new domain, migrated database, separate authentication, the works — took me about 10 days. That\nwould have been impossible a year ago, thanks to AI (of course).\n\nI'm using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) every single day now, and it has fundamentally changed how I ship code.\nAbout 95% of what goes into production is AI-generated — not exaggerating.\n\nIt still requires a ton of hand-holding. I'm often course-correcting, reviewing, and guiding\nit toward the right solution. It's like having a brilliant junior developer who types at 1000 words per minute but needs\nvery specific instructions.

Idea &amp; Validation**\n\n* Clearly define the single problem the app solves (still refining this).\n* Do market research to understand existing tools &amp; where they fall short.\n* Test interest with a simple landing page and share it with a small group.\n\n**2. Design &amp; Planning**\n\n* Create basic wireframes and user flows.\n* Design a clickable prototype (Figma) to test UX before coding.\n* Choose stack: starting with a web app (React + Firebase) → later moving to Expo for mobile.\n\n**3. Development &amp; Testing**\n\n* Build only the core feature (MVP).\n* Use it myself daily to see if it actually helps.\n* Share with early testers and gather real feedback before scaling.\n\n**4. Launch &amp; Post-Launch**\n\n* Do a small beta release (not straight to the app stores).\n* Iterate based on usage &amp; retention.\n* Once it’s useful and sticky → public launch + gradual marketing.\n\nThe reason I’m taking this approach: I don’t want to spend months coding only to realize nobody needs it.

Would You Use This?","selftext":"Hey r/SaaS,\n\nSolo founder here—I've got some AI experience from past side hustles, and I'm wrapping up the MVP for **SaaS Shield**, an automated security scanner that catches holes in your site and APIs before they wreck your launch. It's like OWASP Top 10 on steroids, but stupid-simple for us non-security pros.\n\nLook, we've all shipped an MVP, landed a few users, and then—wham—some dumb vuln like XSS or a leaky endpoint blows up your trust (or your bank account). I know the feeling: Last project, I burned a full weekend patching a SQLi that could've been spotted in minutes. Stats don't lie—80% of small sites have these basic exploits, and they hit bootstrappers like us hardest when we're just getting traction. Manual pentests? $5k and a month of waiting. Big tools like Burp? Way too clunky. That's why I built this: AI that safely \"stresses\" your setup, flags the risks, and hands you dead-easy fixes.\n\nHere's the deal in a nutshell:\n- **Frontend Scan**: Toss in your URL—we crawl the pages (playing nice with robots.txt), mimic user clicks and forms, and spot stuff like XSS or CSRF (e.g., \"Your login form's wide open—here's the exact payload that'd break it\").\n- **Backend Break Test**: Give us scoped API access (think OAuth, read-only, expires in an hour)—we fuzz endpoints for injections or auth slips, pulling out vulns like \"SQL dump on /users—lock it down with this snippet.\"\n- **What You Get**: A quick dashboard report in 5-15 minutes, with risk scores, code fixes, and even pivot tips (e.g., \"Shaky auth? Ditch it for JWT before users bail\"). Not a full cert pentest, but it nails 80-90% of the crap that kills early momentum.\n\nEarly birds in? Lifetime free access plus my direct line for feedback—I'm all ears on what'd make this a no-brainer for you.\n\nWould you plug this in weekly pre-launch or during iterations? What's your biggest headache—frontend glitches, API nightmares, or just the whole \"am I secure enough?\" paranoia?

We've been perfecting our remote model for 5+ years while everyone was obsessed with onsite talent.\n\n\nNow the tables have turned completely.\n\nHere's what just happened to the economics:\n\n\nOld model: $5K visa fee + $120K salary = $125K/year per developer\n\n\nNew model: $100K visa fee + $120K salary = $220K/year per developer\n\n\nStigeUp model: $0 visa fee + $35K-50K = Total cost per developer\n\n\nThis week alone:\n\n→ 400% increase in discovery calls from US companies\n\n→ 3 Fortune 500s asked for emergency team scaling\n\n→ $2M in new contracts signed (vs our usual $200K/month)\n\n\nWhy we're winning these deals:\n\n✅ 5+ years of remote mastery (not a pandemic pivot)\n\n✅ Specialized in high-demand tech: AI/ML, Blockchain, IoT\n\n✅ US timezone overlap: 4-6 hours daily for real collaboration\n\n✅ Proven results: 200+ successful projects, 95% client retention\n\n\nREAL EXAMPLE:\n\nA Chicago fintech was spending $440K/year for 2 H1B developers. They switched to our 4-person AI team for $180K/year. Net savings: $260K annually + they got 2x more output.\n\n\nHere's the thing most people miss:\n\n\nThis isn't just about cost savings. It's about access to specialized talent that's actually HARDER to find in the US market.\n\n\nOur blockchain developer has 8 years experience. Our AI engineer published 3 research papers. Try finding that combo in Silicon Valley for under $200K.\n\n\nThe shift is happening whether you're ready or not.\n\n\nCompanies that adapt fast will dominate their markets. Those clinging to expensive onsite models will bleed cash while competitors scale faster and cheaper.\n\n\nFor entrepreneurs reading this:\n\nIf you're building something tech-heavy, now's the time to explore offshore partnerships.

Worst feeling lol\n\nEvery new customer I signed up got canceled out by churn. Growth equaled loss, and I was stuck at $1.5k MRR.\n\nThe painful part was realizing that acquisition wasn’t the issue. The real problem was that people weren’t staying long enough to see the value. They’d buy it, forget about it, don't see the full potential, and ultimately leave.\n\nI forced myself to stop thinking about more leads and instead obsess over more retention. \n\nHere are the steps I did that truly helped fix churn. For context, my product is [Blogbuster](https://blogbuster.so) (SEO content automation). But the principles apply to any SaaS:\n\n**1. Dedicated onboarding calls**  \nI now offer a one-on-one call to every new customer right after purchase. If they jump in, I walk through their situation, review their SEO strategy, and show how the tool can save them hours each week. It takes me 30 minutes for each but massively increases satisfaction and usage of the product in the first days.\n\n**2. Low-usage alerts**  \nI set up alerts when accounts have very low activity. If I see someone barely touching the product, they get a personal email from me. Not a template, but a short note encouraging them to schedule posts ahead or take a specific next step. This small nudge often reactivates usage before it’s too late.\n\n**3. Conversations over automation**  \nI used to think the best SaaS was “hands-off” and fully self-serve. Turns out, early-stage SaaS is the opposite. The more I talk to my users, the less they churn.

I was pouring 80 hour weeks into building features, but our MRR kept flatlining. Churn was spiking, and I couldn't figure out why.\n\nI'd always focused on the big stuff, market fit, ad spend, new features. But I was missing the quiet killers: the \"blindspots.\" These aren't big, obvious problems. They're subtle gaps in your workflow, habits, or data that you're too close to see. For me, it was a tiny friction point in our onboarding that was leaking 20% of our trial users before they even got started.\n\nI finally found a way to rip the veil off these blindspots using a custom AI prompt. It uses a conversational style to uncover hidden patterns that your data or daily routine is hiding. The prompt asks three simple questions, and the AI gives you three actionable insights.\n\nI've pasted the core prompt below. You can copy it and paste it into ChatGPT, Grok, or Claude.\n\n**The Blindspot Revealer Prompt:**\n\n\"You are a Blindspot Illuminator, an expert in using AI to uncover hidden insights and pains in personal and professional contexts.\n\nYour goal is to reveal my blindspots. First, ask me these three questions, one at a time, to collect context:\n\n1. What's your main area of focus right now (e.g., your SaaS, your habits, or a specific strategy)?\n2. Share a recent challenge or a pattern you've noticed.\n3. What AI tools or features are you currently using?\n\nAfter I've answered, reveal three of my most critical blindspots. For each blindspot, provide evidence based on my answers and give me one actionable step to fix it.\"\n\nUsing this, I was able to spot that onboarding issue and fix it overnight. It’s a game changer because it doesn’t guess, it illuminates.\n\nIf you’re interested in a more detailed breakdown of how this worked and how it's helped other founders, I wrote a full post about it on my Substack.

Earlier this year I realised that most of my time spent by UGC creators wasn’t spent being creative – it was spent copy‑writing hooks, juggling teleprompter apps and burning captions. By the time a 20‑second clip went live I’d often sunk hours into it.\n\nThat pain pushed me to build **HookPilot**, an AI‑powered workflow for short‑form video. It’s not a timeline editor; it’s more like a coach that sits with you while you create. Here’s how it works for me:\n\n1. **Tell it your niche and topic** – for example “indie game marketing” or “quick nutrition tips”. The AI spits out **ten hook variations and a complete script** so I’m not staring at a blank page.\n2. **Pick a tone &amp; call‑to‑action** – energetic, conversational, educational, etc. It gives me a shot list and B‑roll prompts.\n3. **Read with the built‑in teleprompter** – I adjust words per minute and start delay to match my style.\n4. **Upload the clip &amp; get captions instantly** – HookPilot generates SRT files and animates captions (karaoke, bounce, typewriter). I preview in‑browser and export a 1080×1920 clip that’s ready for TikTok, Reels or Shorts.\n\nThe whole process – from idea to export – usually takes me under ten minutes. I no longer juggle four different tools or spend a Sunday afternoon on captions.\n\nI’m opening a small early‑access cohort and would love feedback from fellow creators and marketers. The Pro plan will even support custom branding/white‑label rights for agencies. If you’re constantly making vertical video and want to try it out (or just want to roast my workflow), I’d appreciate your honest thoughts.\n\n**Questions for you:**\n\n* What part of your short‑form workflow feels like the biggest time sink?\n* Would AI‑generated hooks/scripts be helpful, or do you prefer writing everything from scratch?\n* Any “must‑have” features you think a tool like this is missing?\n\nIf you’re curious, feel free to DM me and if you want to be on the waitlist you can check this [link](https://www.hookpilotai.com).

The loop looks simple on paper:\n\t1.\tSpeech to text – capture audio from the system or mic.\n\t2.\tMachine translation – take that raw transcript and convert it into the target language.\n\t3.\tText to speech – optionally play the translated text back so it feels seamless.\n\t4.\tOCR – grab text directly off the screen (menus, dialogue, HUD) and push it through the same flow.\n\nWhat surprised me:\n\t•\tSTT is fast but handling background noise (footsteps, wind, random sound effects) matters way more than I thought. Without suppression/EQ, you get junk transcriptions.\n\t•\tTranslation accuracy depends on matching the right model size to the task. Big multilingual models are accurate but heavy; smaller domain-specific ones feel snappier.\n\t•\tTTS is optional but powerful — for some users, hearing the translation matters more than seeing it on screen. Others only want captions. Building both unlocked new use cases.\n\t•\tLatency is king.

How Did That Actually Work?","selftext":"I’m genuinely curious.\n\nFrom my experience building products in B2B SaaS, it feels nearly impossible - without deep collaboration between founders, product teams, and customers. It’s not just about writing code. It’s about translating messy user feedback, evolving positioning, and making tradeoffs in real time.\n\nSo, when I hear about startups outsourcing their entire product build to an agency, I can’t help but wonder:\n\nWho’s driving product management in that setup?\n\nWho’s making the calls on UX tradeoffs, prioritizing features, handling pivots, and integrating customer insights?\n\nAlso, wouldn’t the agency be naturally inclined to make decisions that optimize for their own margins, not necessarily long-term product success?\n\nBecause in my world, product development is a living conversation. It needs:\n\n* Founder intuition and strategic clarity\n* Customer feedback loops and iteration\n* Cross-functional collaboration between design, dev, and product\n* Real-time decisions based on what’s landing and what’s not\n\nI’m not saying it can’t be done. I just don’t understand how it works without feeling disconnected from the product’s soul.\n\nIf you’ve done it, outsourced your build to an agency? how did you structure it?  \nDid you have an internal PM? Did the agency own product decisions?  \nDid it actually work long-term?\n\nTrying to wrap my head around what’s possible and what’s just wishful thinking.","author":"B2BSaaSExpert","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nnelss/has_anyone_successfully_outsourced_product/","domain":"self.SaaS","score":1,"num_comments":0,"created_utc":1758520777,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnefda","subreddit":"SaaS","title":"What frustrates you most about email?

Not because candidates aren't qualified, but because they make the same 5 critical tailoring mistakes over and over.\n\nThe 7-Second Reality Check Studies show recruiters spend an average of 7.4 seconds on initial resume review. Eye-tracking research reveals they look at: Name (1 sec) → Current title (2 sec) → Current company (1.5 sec) → Previous positions (2 sec) → Education (0.9 sec). If you haven't hooked them by then, you're out. Mistake #1: The \"Spray and Pray\" Approach\n\nUsing the same generic resume for every application is career suicide. ATS systems can detect generic resumes instantly, and they're programmed to rank them lower. Your beautifully designed, one-size-fits-all resume? It's probably scoring 20-30% match rate.\n\nReal Example: Marketing Manager Application\n\n❌ Generic Version (30% match):\n\n\"Experienced marketing professional with 5+ years driving brand growth and managing campaigns.\" ✅ Tailored Version (78% match):\n\n\"B2B SaaS Marketing Manager with 5+ years driving product-led growth, specializing in HubSpot automation and Account-Based Marketing (ABM) strategies.\" The tailored version mirrors the exact language from the job posting: \"B2B SaaS,\" \"product-led growth,\" \"HubSpot,\" and \"ABM.\" The Manual Fix:\n\nCreate 3-5 base versions targeting different role types. Here's the framework:\n\n• Version 1: Industry-Specific (e.g., \"SaaS Marketing Manager\") • Version 2: Company-Size Specific (e.g., \"Startup Marketing Manager\") • Version 3: Skill-Specific (e.g., \"Digital Marketing Analytics Manager\") • Version 4: Level-Specific (e.g., \"Senior Marketing Manager\") • Version 5: Function-Specific (e.g., \"Product Marketing Manager\") Then spend 10 minutes customizing from these bases rather than starting from scratch. 🚀 Smart Resume Optimization:\n\nMistake #2: Keyword Stuffing Without Context\n\nYes, keywords matter. But jamming them in without context is worse than not having them at all. Modern ATS systems use contextual analysis—they know when you're gaming the system.\n\nThe Keyword Stuffing Disaster:\n\n❌ What NOT to Do (Obvious Stuffing):\n\n\"Skills: Python, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, SQL, Python, Tableau, Python, Statistics, Python, Deep Learning, Python\" ATS Flag: Keyword density too high, context missing, obvious gaming attempt ✅ The Right Way (Natural Integration):\n\n\"Developed Python-based machine learning models that improved customer churn prediction by 34%, utilizing SQL for data extraction and Tableau for executive dashboards. Led cross-functional team in implementing deep learning algorithms for real-time fraud detection.\" ATS Score: High match, natural context, demonstrates actual usage The 70-20-10 Keyword Strategy:\n\n70% Core Keywords: Match exact terms from \"Requirements\" section 20% Related Keywords: Include synonyms and related technologies 10% Advanced Keywords: Add next-level skills they didn't mention Example for Data Analyst Role:\n\n• 70%: SQL, Excel, Python, Tableau (from job posting) • 20%: MySQL, Google Sheets, pandas, Power BI (related) • 10%: Apache Spark, MLOps (shows growth potential) The Manual Fix:\n\nUse the STAR method to naturally embed keywords:\n\n• Situation: Set context with industry terms • Task: Include role-specific keywords • Action: Mention tools and methodologies • Result: Quantify with metrics keywords love Example: \"Faced with declining user engagement (Situation), tasked with improving retention metrics (Task), implemented A/B testing using Optimizely and analyzed results with Python (Action), resulting in 23% increase in DAU and $1.2M additional revenue (Result).\"\n\nIt’s too long too post here but you can checkout the blog for more info","author":"Sam2insane420","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nnedle/5_resume_tailoring_mistakes_that_kill_your/","domain":"self.SaaS","score":1,"num_comments":2,"created_utc":1758519942,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nne2sl","subreddit":"SaaS","title":"Offering MVP SaaS Development (Milestone based work)","selftext":"Hey 👋\n\nIf you are looking for any web developer I can help you build a SaaS from scratch and add custom functionality for you.

It’s all about understanding human psychology and virality\n\nOn the other hand,\n\nB2B SaaS is the path to master sales. You'll learn how to sell to other businesses, even if you just showed up in the market with. You'll master cold outreach, leveraging platforms like LinkedIn for distribution, and crafting a compelling narrative for a professional audience. You'll have to pitch your product with conviction, even with zero background, and you'll learn how to handle objections and build trust with a business client.\n\ni chose the consumer app route because i wanted to learn how to make something go viral on social media first. for the past two weeks, I've been building an AI-powered consumer app for health and fitness, and I'm really glad I made this choice. its been an incredible learning experience despite all the challenges\n\nall that being said, i do believe the big profits are often in B2B and high-ticket sales. so i know I'll be leaning towards B2B in the long run.\n\nUltimately, the problem you want to solve will also guide your decision","author":"ReporterOne1776","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nnalqf/saas_or_app_ask_what_skills_do_i_want_to_learn/","domain":"self.SaaS","score":1,"num_comments":0,"created_utc":1758507677,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nna6o5","subreddit":"SaaS","title":"How do you get traction for an open source i18n project?","selftext":"I built an open source internationalization (i18n) tool that I think solves i18n way better than what’s out there.

Raise like 2-10m and get turnover of about 10-20 percent of the raise.

No glue work. Everything happens where my team already works: GitHub.\n\nThe result? Our dev cycle time has been cut nearly in half.\n\nAnd the team actually likes it.\n\nQuestions to you all •\tWould you let the ScaffoldAgent open draft PRs in your repo, or would you prefer copy-paste artifacts only? •\tPlannerAgent: auto-create issues or suggest-only (manual trigger)? Which do you actually want? •\tFor security teams: hosted service with strong tenant RLS, or self-host so you keep keys/data — which do you trust more? •\tIf you use this kind of system, what’s the one feature that would make you adopt it tomorrow?","author":"Nearby_Foundation484","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nn2yu4/this_multiai_agent_tool_cut_our_dev_cycle_in_half/","domain":"self.SaaS","score":2,"num_comments":1,"created_utc":1758487084,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nn25iv","subreddit":"SaaS","title":"💡 Feedback needed: Building a simple Loom alternative — Do I need to add an upload feature?","selftext":"Hey everyone 👋\n\nI’m working on a super lightweight **screen recording + hosting tool** (similar to Loom, but simpler and much cheaper).

When you’re trying to practice handling objections between actual client calls, waiting 30 seconds for the AI to respond kills the whole flow. We built it thinking “this is pretty cool” but forgot that agents need it to be lightning fast to actually fit into their day.\n\nSo we’ve been in the trenches this week, tearing apart code and rebuilding it to run smoother. Good news is we’re seeing real improvements - response times are down significantly and the conversations feel way more natural now.\n\nThe funny part?

Process breakdown below.\n\nWhen done correctly, this can increase activation rate, retention, conversion rate AND reduce churn - improving all KPIs that boost your SaaS valuation.\n\n**The system (4 steps):**\n\n**1. Track everything with a CDP.** Connect all your SaaS user data sources to track every action. Some that I like: RudderStack, PostHog, Segment, amplitude (has some CDP-like features). CDPs allow you to create a unified customer view where you learn your users key drop off points - crucial for product led growth.\n\n**2. Connect to email platform.** Link to your chosen email marketing platform - my favorite email marketing platforms for SAAS are; Loops so, Customer io &amp; Encharge. Segment users based on actions and current stage. Audience segments are constantly updated via API.\n\n**3. Deploy these 9 core flows.** Value-focused multi-step flows to guide users to the next stage. Not spam - only triggered by what they have/haven't done.\n\n* **Welcome** \\- Coach to first \"Aha!\" moment (Trigger: Account created)\n* **Onboarding** \\- Feature education tied to use-case (Trigger: Key milestone/action completed)\n* **No-Login** \\- Re-engage silent users (Trigger: No login for n days)\n* **Gamification/Progress** \\- Celebrate wins, create momentum (Trigger: Task completion)\n* **Feature Limitation** \\- Highlight premium features (Trigger: Gated feature attempt/ tokens limit reached/near)\n* **Referral** \\- Turn users into advocates (Trigger: Activation milestone)\n* **Cancellation** \\- Rescue at-risk accounts (Trigger: Viewed cancellation page x times)\n* **Abandoned Payment** \\- Recover failed checkouts (Trigger: Checkout started &amp; not completed)\n* **Payment Declined** \\- Prevent involuntary churn (Trigger: Charge failed)\n\nThere will be more flows that are unique to your app though these 9 apply to the majority of SaaS. Other examples of flows you might want to implement to drive product led growth are; testimonial/review request flow, user feedback/survey flow and feature request flows.\n\n**4. A/B test and optimize.** Test messaging at every stage. Route data to dashboards showing which emails drive upgrades and how key SaaS growth metrics improve.\n\n**Example - Simple math to show potential impact:**  \nLet's say you have 100 trial signups → 40% activate → 15% of those convert = 6 paying customers\n\nIf your automated flows boost activation by 20 points: 100 signups → 60% activate → 15% convert = 9 customers (50% increase)\n\nAt scale:  \n1,000 signups: 60 vs 90 paid users  \n10,000 signups: 600 vs 900 paid users\n\n*Note: I'm using 15% activation-to-paid conversion which is conservative - many SaaS see higher rates with proper flows. the purpose of this example is to show the value of increasing activation rates using this system*\n\nAs your product scales, this lever will provide more significant results. This example doesn't touch on other crucial benefits such as; churn reduction, improved feature adoption, higher retention, and increased engagement throughout the customer lifecycle.\n\n**When this works best:** When you have reached product-market fit and have a consistent user acquisition channel where small improvements will begin to compound fast at scale.\n\nI've compiled 500+ real email examples from successful SaaS companies across these flow types (as well as other flow/campaign types) - might be helpful when planning your own flows/emails. let me know if you would like it.","author":"StrikingAngle882","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nmztvt/how_to_increase_saas_trial_conversions_improve/","domain":"self.SaaS","score":8,"num_comments":6,"created_utc":1758479856,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nmzr2c","subreddit":"SaaS","title":"Saas idea","selftext":"Kids spend hours scrolling TikTok and Instagram, but almost none of that time actually builds their brains.

They're creating the SAME content in different languages.\n\nOne core idea becomes:\n\n* A LinkedIn article about industry insights\n* A TikTok trend participation\n* A Twitter controversy thread\n* A Reddit storytelling post\n\n**Same brain, different voices.**\n\nAfter watching these creators struggle, I got obsessed with solving this problem. I spent months building a system that takes any video content and translates it into each platform's native language.\n\n**The results in my own testing:**\n\n* Same time investment as before\n* 6x the reach across platforms\n* Actually making money instead of just getting views\n* Each platform feels authentic, not recycled\n\n**Those Starbucks creators are still making $300/month because they're speaking English in six different countries.**\n\n**Want to see if this translation approach works for your content?** [**forthefeed.com**](http://forthefeed.com)\n\n**Coffee shop question:** What's the worst content advice you've overheard someone give?

Brainstorming an AI Tool to Automate Validation (No Sales Pitch, Just Sharing Thoughts)","selftext":"Hey,\n\nI see that like me, a lot of folks here are grinding away trying to come up with a solid SaaS idea, or they've got one brewing but have no clue how to properly validate it. In my last post on this sub, I threw out that maybe \"SaaS isn't the way\" – but I didn't totally mean it like that. I kinda did, but let me clarify: What I really think is that we just need a tool to streamline how we generate and validate ideas. So many of ours (mine included) are straight-up crappy, and trust me, I've clung to some dumb ones in my head for way too long, nurturing them like they're my kid. Then reality hits – the market doesn't care about my feelings, and if the product's not useful, it's game over. That's got me pondering some kind of automation to speed up validation: Dump the bad ideas in the bin quicker, and focus our energy on polishing the winners.\n\nI've been sketching out what this could look like as a simple AI tool – nothing built yet, just for my own sanity at first. You'd input a quick app/SaaS description, and it'd handle the heavy lifting:\n\n* **Market Research Automation**: Dives into competitors (like similar apps on stores, their ratings and reviews), checks search trends (using stuff like Google Trends or Ahrefs APIs), and pulls user signals from social media, Reddit threads, forums, and industry sites. It'd highlight opportunities and warn about red flags, like if the space is totally oversaturated.\n* **Technical Roadmap Generation**: Breaks features into a prioritized list, recommends tech stacks (e.g., React Native for cross-platform mobile, Firebase for easy backend), and gives rough timelines (like 4-6 weeks for an MVP).\n* **Idea Scoring System**: Gives it a 1-10 score on market potential, competition level, and tech feasibility – all backed by actual data, not just vibes.\n* **Project Management Features**: Lets you tweak plans, add notes to features, track progress, and maybe sync with tools like Trello or Notion.\n\nBut hey, this is just my rough vision – it could be something totally different. I'm not locked in, and honestly, I'd love to hear from you all. What parts of idea generation or validation do you think scream for automation the most? Like, where do you guys waste the most time or get stuck the longest – competitor digging, user feedback hunting, trend analysis, or something else entirely? What's the biggest headache that always drags you down?\n\nNo agenda here – I'm not selling anything or pushing a product. Just a solo dev tired of the manual grind, wondering if this solves a real pain for others before I tinker with code.

Here’s a breakdown of the approach that drove results for his brands, PostBridge and Curiosity Quench:\n\n• Built tools to solve real, personal problems, then identified broader demand. PostBridge began as a social media scheduling tool Jack created for his own use, which quickly gained traction when others expressed interest. ([Sonar](https://sonar.wtf) can help with surfacing painpoints among a audience group)\n\n• Used content marketing as the primary growth engine. Jack produced daily videos about his products, focusing on formats that already performed well in his niche. He studied viral content, recreated it with his brand’s angle, and included subtle calls to action. (Tangential - [Redditpilot](http://Redditpilot.com) can help with Reddit Marketing)\n\n• Prioritized [TikTok](http://tiktok.com) and [Instagram](http://instagram.com) for organic reach. These platforms provided the largest audiences and highest engagement for app promotion. Jack recommends focusing on one account first, mastering content that drives views and downloads before branching out.\n\n• Warmed up new accounts before posting. He spent several days engaging with niche content, commenting, and following relevant accounts to avoid being flagged as spam and to train the algorithm.\n\n• Posted consistently and iterated. Jack made daily content for months, refining his approach based on what drove downloads. Once a format delivered results, he reused it across multiple posts and pages.\n\n• Leveraged influencer partnerships strategically. Instead of spending on large influencers, Jack found more value in working with smaller accounts on retainer or per-view arrangements.\n\n• Automated posting only after initial traction. Manual posting was used in the early stages to ensure authenticity and platform compliance. Automation with PostBridge came only after accounts were established.\n\n• Expanded to other platforms only after proving success on core channels. Once a format worked on TikTok or Instagram, Jack repurposed content to YouTube, Twitter, and Threads for additional reach.\n\nJack’s method shows that SaaS and app founders can reach significant revenue milestones by focusing on organic social growth, consistent content creation, and solving real problems—without relying on paid ads.","author":"Medium-Importance270","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nmsv64/scaled_to_10k_mrr_without_ads/","domain":"self.SaaS","score":3,"num_comments":1,"created_utc":1758463546,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nmsm3o","subreddit":"SaaS","title":"Why your 'simple' SaaS will take 6 months to build (and how to actually make it simple)","selftext":"\"It's just like Instagram, but for dog owners.\"\n\nI hear this weekly.

I started with a few important core design ideas for this app to make it helpful in real life. These were:\n\n* The quest will be generated using AI and you can personalize it as well.\n* The design will be inspired by Solo Leveling to give the same vibes.\n* A few original SYSTEM concepts like time limits will be removed because everyone cannot have that much free time to follow that like the original anime. (This can be changed if you guys want me to change this in a future update.)\n* The app design will be more like a game rather than a gym tracker app.\n* Along with Gym, I added Art as well (Gym and Art being two most popular daily hobbies for everyone). There's also a MISC section if you want to add any other quest not fitting in Gym or Art.\n\n# So I started making this in a Game Engine. I wanted to make an app to show to my users (which I did today) and actively update it based on the users' feedback (which I will be doing from now on).\n\n# How It Works?\n\nIn this System, you can generate random quests which you have to complete to gain skill points and XP. I will be adding more achievements, leader-board, and quest sharing features in the next version as well. I plan to make it more game-like where you have to complete quests in real life.\n\nEvery quest you are assigned will be completed when you add your picture of completing that quest (you can also opt not to add the picture by just closing the camera to use the default image). This method of completing quests motivates you to complete them, and when you look back at those pictures, they will be showing your level-up journey as well.\n\nThe plan is to target a niche community of the popular anime Solo Leveling but the app I believe can replace your habit-tracker or self-improvement apps.

Even those who claim to be tech savvy tend to argue with me in saying that the product already exists and what not, but after a 10-15 minute conversation, they understand how it works and go \"great idea, this will make you rich\". Every single person I've spoken to at length has said \"it's a great idea, I've bet you've sold thousands, which retailers will stock you blah blah blah\".\n\nI have also noticed that some of my friends who have said they get it and that it's a great idea, later confess that they still don't get it but they want it. It isn't until I physically show them how it works that they go, holy scchitte, NOW I GET IT! Whoa! Great idea!\n\nThe problem is it takes me a good 2-5 minutes to physically demo the product and showcase all the features for it all to make sense to the buyer. Even then they ask a few follow up questions and I feel that not everything is getting thru. It is a technically complex product that solves a problem that people don't really know they have, it's like selling toothpaste to people who brush their teeth with sticks. I've had a handful of professionals reach out to me inquiring about the product and asking if they can recommend it to their clients too.\n\nThat throws text ads out the window, I'm concerned that if I go through all the trouble of making a video ad, people will skip it because the first few minutes do not paint enough of a picture for the person to get it and I can't think of an angle to introduce it as a whole as it has many features that together make it a great device. That will kill my limited budget.\n\nThe main idea I've had so far is to do trade shows or swap meets where I can get the attention of people with candy or with my amazing smile (yeah right), pitch the product to them in different ways, collect data, and then come up with a better advertisement down the track, but I was wondering if anyone here has had this sort of problem and how they overcame it. \n\nI'm working on creating the marketing materials for a 3mX3m tent, but man, if there's anything else I could do other than have to go on the road, please, tell me. I have a physical condition that makes it difficult for me to travel but I have to do it to survive but I'm dreeeeeeading the whole thing and seeing it as an ordeal.

An inbox is stable.\n\nEmail subscribers are 40X more likely to make a purchase than random followers.\n\nOwning attention &gt; renting attention.\n\n# 3/ Pick 3 channels and go deep\n\nSpreading across 10 platforms = being mediocre everywhere.\n\nI’d probably use X/Twitter to test ideas fast, and LinkedIn to turn those ideas into business.\n\nI also use Reddit to share my ideas and get honest feedback from users.\n\nEverything else can wait.\n\n# 4/ Treat YouTube like a search engine\n\nPeople go there *looking* for solutions.\n\nA single video can bring leads for years.\n\nThink of it as dropping digital billboards that never expire.\n\n# 5/ Write morning pages\n\nThree messy pages every morning. No editing, no filter.\n\nThat habit forces clarity, and clarity eventually turns into a unique voice.\n\n# 6/ Build in public\n\nNobody cares about faceless brands. People care about stories.\n\nI’d share the failures, the pivots, the random “wtf” moments.\n\nBeing open creates trust. Trust sells.\n\n# 7/ Repurpose like Netflix\n\nNetflix doesn’t film 1,000 shows a week, and they make one, then milk it.\n\nOne blog post = clips, tweets, LinkedIn posts, and a short video.\n\nWork once, distribute forever.\n\n# 8/ Network like it’s cardio\n\nNot the fake “let’s connect” stuff. Real conversations, no strings attached.\n\nFive new genuine connections a day compound faster than you think.\n\n# 9/ Price for value, not for volume\n\nI’d rather have 10 customers paying a premium than 1,000 paying scraps.\n\nHigh-value customers bring bigger problems worth solving.\n\n# 10/ Obsess over systems\n\nDocument, automate, delegate.\n\nIf everything depends on my energy, I’ll burn out.\n\nSystems turn chaos into progress.\n\n# 11/ Think long-term\n\nForget quarterly dopamine. Most “overnight successes” are a decade in the making.\n\nFall in love with the grind, not just the payday.\n\n# 12/ Protect health like it’s equity\n\nA broken body = a broken business.\n\nDeep work in the morning, workouts before lunch, and no death-by-meeting schedules.\n\n# 13.

Write a few reviews, share my thoughts on the latest mobiles, and somehow, readers would pour in. That was the picture in my head. Reality? Hardly anyone even clicked. My articles were just floating around, unnoticed.\n\nFor a while, I couldn’t figure it out. I kept posting, hoping something would take off. It didn’t. That’s when it hit me, enthusiasm alone isn’t enough.\n\nThe first realisation was simple: **keywords matter more than passion**. I used to chase generic stuff like *“iPhone 16 review.”* No chance of ranking. The day I wrote a post around *“iPhone 16 vs S24 FE low-light camera test,”* things shifted. Smaller search, yes, but people actually found me. That little change made me rethink everything.\n\nThe second thing I discovered, and this one stung, is that **opinions beat rewrites**. Readers aren’t daft. They know when you’ve recycled someone else’s piece. The moment I stopped playing safe and started saying what *I* actually felt (like, “this battery is pathetic” or “this is the one feature worth paying for”), engagement jumped. It felt more like a chat than a lecture.\n\nAnd lastly, I realised it’s not about choosing between trending or evergreen topics. It’s about using both. Evergreen posts, like *“Best laptops for students under ₹50k”*, keep trickling visitors in months later.

Wild how many of us are dealing with the same stuff. Thanks for all the stories and tips. They really made me rethink the flow at my café.\n\nHere’s what I landed on:\n\nNo columns. I’m not keen on paying for them. They eat up space and don’t look great. I went with clear signs and let the furniture do the guiding. I put a narrow table near the entrance so people naturally follow the path without getting blocked.\n\nThe pickup shelf was the tricky part. I tested a few layouts based on how people move, and I tried mocking them up in xdesign to visualize the traffic flow.\n\nNear the door made the entrance feel tight, especially when people were coming and going. Too far from the counter meant an awkward detour that broke the flow. What worked best was placing the shelf in front of the counter, just a bit off to the side. Easy grab, no bottleneck.\n\nAbout hiring a designer, I get the suggestions, but rates here are high. I finally decided to try it myself, still.\n\nI’m also planning a soft opening with a friend helping out. It will cost a little extra, but still way less than a designer, and it should surface any layout issues I missed before opening fully.\n\nI’m still tweaking a few details, but the flow already feels better.

If you serve customers locally, this is probably more important than trying to rank nationally.\n\nLocal SEO works differently than regular SEO. Instead of competing with every business worldwide, you're mainly competing with other businesses in your city or region. Google prioritizes location when showing search results for local services.\n\nYour Google Business Profile is the most important piece. This is the listing that shows up in Google Maps and local search results. It displays your address, hours, phone number, photos, and customer reviews. Keeping this information accurate and updated directly affects your local search visibility.\n\nCustomer reviews play a major role in local rankings. Businesses with more positive reviews typically rank higher than those with fewer reviews. Responding to reviews, both positive and negative, also signals to Google that you're actively managing your online presence.\n\nYour website needs location-specific information to rank locally. Include your city and service area in your page content naturally. Create separate pages for different locations if you serve multiple areas. Don't stuff keywords unnaturally, but make sure your location is clear.\n\nConsistency across online directories matters. Your business name, address, and phone number should match exactly across Google, Yelp, Facebook, industry directories, and your website. Inconsistent information confuses search engines and can hurt your rankings.\n\nLocal keywords work differently than broad keywords. People search for \"plumber near me\" or \"pizza downtown\" rather than just \"plumber\" or \"pizza.\" Include location-based terms in your website content and page titles where relevant.\n\nBuilding local citations helps establish credibility. Citations are mentions of your business name, address, and phone number on other websites like directories, local business associations, or community websites. Quality matters more than quantity.\n\nMobile optimization is crucial for local SEO since most local searches happen on phones. Your website must load quickly and work well on mobile devices. Google uses mobile performance as a ranking factor.\n\nLocal SEO takes time to show results. Changes to your Google Business Profile might appear within days, but improvements to website rankings typically take weeks or months. Consistency and patience are important for long-term success.\n\nAnyone seeing good results from local SEO efforts, or struggling with specific aspects of local search optimization?","author":"ExtensionAct8058","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nnhl12/local_seo_what_small_businesses_need_to_know/","domain":"self.smallbusiness","score":1,"num_comments":2,"created_utc":1758532345,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnhbde","subreddit":"smallbusiness","title":"How do you handle costomer re engagement without geting locked into expensive SaaS subscription?","selftext":"I’m looking for a reliable way to send browser notifications to customers and re-engage them with my website.

I use Square to send invoices and collect payment for all of the items that I have sold so far. Yesterday I got an email from Square saying that I got my first credit card payment dispute. It says that they have not received their items. For context, it was a $350 invoice that they had made multiple payments on for over a period of almost 3 months. When they paid it off I did was not able to immediately ship the items. But was in contact with the customer. When they had asked me if the items were shipped yet I was honest and told them the truth, which was that their items were ready to go out but I was having issues with USPS not picking items up when I requested for pickup. I ended up walking their package up to the post office on Monday September 15th, as I stated that I would do in a message to them. I hadn't heard anything from them at all... until yesterday when I got the email from square about the payment dispute.It says I have until the 27th to respond with evidence and my side, which I still neee to do, but I checked the tracking and it is still not arrived to them.  It does show it should be delivered soon. I did send them a message with tracking information and apologizing they hadn't received the items yet, and stated that items were sent when I said they would be, which the tracking information shows. They left my message on read. Then again today I did reach out to them asking if they would cancel the dispute once their items were received. Again they read the message, but no response. \nSo I'm wondering if I should try to intercept the package from ever being delivered to them?

Set up would include 8 individual pastures with dry-lot and shelter attached to each. free choice quality hay and supplemented with higher quality hay if horse needs more calories, quality grain fed 2x daily, 50ft round pen and 80x120 arena both with footing, small main barn for feed, tack, grooming, and wash rack with 2 stalls that step out into separate dry-lots and connected small pastures for quarantine or injury, separate building for hay storage at a safe distance away from barn. the main barn with round pen and ring will be a central hub with pastures surrounding it so walking distance is minimal for care and training. I have already started sourcing costs and calculating the start up build and will build in stages.\n\nThere is family owned land, several acres that I have gotten the okay to build on and it will be transferred to me at a later time. I will be getting this in writing before building. 15-20 acres for the business. Most of the land is forest with some small fields so of course I'll need to clear some land.

I’m an Industrial Design student working on starting my own brand of everyday essentials,  mainly bags, laptop sleeves, pouches, and eventually other functional items like desk organizers. My goal is to build something design-driven and original (not just rebranding stock products), with an emphasis on both functionality and aesthetics.\n\nI currently have a remote job that provides stable income. Since I’m still in college and fortunate not to cover most living expenses, I can reinvest almost everything into this project. I know this won’t be an overnight success, and I’m prepared to bootstrap slowly until it becomes sustainable.\n\nA few questions I’d love input on:\n\n* **Manufacturers:** Where can I find reliable bag/accessory manufacturers who can work with smaller MOQs (50–100 pcs per design)? For a first run, is it better to look at local production or go straight to overseas options (e.g., China, Vietnam) where equipment and materials may be more advanced since I’m from the Philippines, even with higher shipping/freight costs?  \n* **Prototyping:** How do early-stage brands usually approach this? Do manufacturers typically handle prototyping, or is it smarter to work with independent pattern makers first? Since I want to be heavily involved in design, I’ll prototype some pieces myself, but when scaling, how do I ensure I retain ownership of my designs (e.g., blueprints, tech packs) if I ever need to switch manufacturers?  \n* **Lessons learned:** For those of you who’ve launched fashion/product-based businesses, what’s one thing you wish you had done differently in the early stage, like branding, product testing, working with manufacturers, or managing finances?  \n\nI’d really appreciate insights from anyone who’s built or worked on design-driven consumer brands, especially in the bag/accessories space.

Secondly, a paid feature in the Partner network of our main CMS platform delivers consistent leads. In addition, we do a lot of repeat business with existing customers.\n\nOutside of that, I haven't found too much that is predicable, where I can trace a dollar spent to a result.\n\n1) Organic search: Vexingly, we have been #1 on google (organic) for our most-relevant keyword for a few years now. But in my opinion, SERP are polluted by PPC Ads and Map results. Achieving top 5 SERP position just doesnt' seem to mean what it used to.\n\n2) PPC: I dabble in Google Ads, but tend to turn it off after a few months of minimal results.\n\n3) Email Marketing/Automation: in 2023 I started a 1 year effort with Zoominfo. I was really encouraged by this. Within our first few months, we landed an $80k project from an email campaign. After that, we had lots of high-quality leads that led to sales meetings, making the short-list, although not landing additional sales. After those first successful months, Zoominfo literally became devoid of results. Hundreds of emails would go out a week - zero responses. I like Zoominfo a lot. The platform seems robust and quite clever. But I could justify the $25k/annual cost after the ROI tanked.\n\n4) Content Creation: we regularly write blogs, striving to make the content beneficial to our customer audience. We also send email newsletters regularly.\n\n5) We've sponsored a tech conference or local/community sports teams (never expecting much, but seeing it as a way to give back)\n\nThose are the broad categories I've dabbled in.\n\nI haven't explored LinkedIn, Reddit or Facebook ads. Our audience is primarily B2B. But I'm not opposed to trying any of those.\n\nFor what it's worth, the word of mouth referrals and the partner referrals I mentioned at the top of my post are good for us. But they do seem a little random. I'd love to direct attention and dollars towards something that would provide predictable leads.

Part of me thinks about doing an MBA, but I’m not sure if I’m ready or if I’d actually get the most out of it at this stage. Then there’s coding and AI, which excites me and seems like the future, but starting from scratch feels overwhelming. I also have the option to join my family business, which would be the safe route, though I worry it might keep me from building something on my own. And on top of all that, I keep thinking about startups. I love the idea of starting something new, but I don’t know what to build or even how to begin.\n\nAt 21, I can’t help but feel like I’m already lagging behind compared to people my age who seem to have it all figured out. I want to make something of myself, but right now it feels like I’m just drifting without direction.\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar place or has advice on how to navigate this kind of confusion, I’d really appreciate it.

I would prefer not having to nuke my browser history and cookies to make it work.\n\nDo you have any idea on how to fix it properly? thanks","author":"Lenskha","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nmx743/what_could_be_the_reason_for_some_cdn_images/","domain":"self.webdev","score":1,"num_comments":2,"created_utc":1758473808,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nmx46a","subreddit":"webdev","title":"G code idea","selftext":"class GCodeDigitalSecurity {\n    // Full authentication using G-code structure\n    \n    generateAuthProgram(userId, password) {\n        const key = deriveKey(password);\n        \n        return `\n            ; G-Code Security Program for ${userId}\n            ; This is pure digital - no machine needed\n            \n            N10 G90 ; Absolute auth mode\n            N20 G00 X${key[0]} Y${key[1]} ; Position in keyspace\n            N30 M03 S${key[2] * 100} ; Start encryption\n            N40 G83 X${key[3]} Y${key[4]} Z-${key[5]} Q${key[6]} ; Deep hash cycle\n            N50 G91 ; Switch to incremental\n            N60 G01 X10 Y10 F${key[7]} ; Incremental auth steps\n            N70 M06 T${key[8] % 10} ; Rotate to key slot\n            N80 G90 ; Back to absolute\n            N90 G28 ; Return to origin (reset state)\n            N100 M05 ; Stop encryption\n            N110 M30 ; End program\n        `;\n    }\n    \n    verifyAuthProgram(gcode, userId) {\n        const state = {\n            position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 },\n            mode: 'G90',\n            crypto: false,\n            tool: 0,\n            hashValue: 0\n        };\n        \n        // Execute the G-code virtually\n        gcode.split('\\n').forEach(line =&gt; {\n            const cmd = this.parseLine(line);\n            \n            switch(cmd.type) {\n                case 'G00': // Rapid position\n                    state.position = cmd.coords;\n                    state.hashValue = hash(state.position);\n                    break;\n                    \n                case 'G83': // Deep drilling cycle\n                    // Multiple hash iterations\n                    for (let i = 0; i &lt; cmd.Q; i++) {\n                        state.hashValue = hash(state.hashValue + i);\n                    }\n                    break;\n                    \n                case 'M03': // Start crypto\n                    state.crypto = true;\n                    state.keySize = cmd.S;\n                    break;\n                    \n                case 'M06': // Tool/key change\n                    state.tool = cmd.T;\n                    state.hashValue = rotateKey(state.hashValue, state.tool);\n                    break;\n            }\n        });\n        \n        // Verify final state matches expected for user\n        const expected = this.computeExpectedState(userId);\n        return state.hashValue === expected.hashValue;\n    }\n}","author":"Odd-Alternative-8507","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nmx46a/g_code_idea/","domain":"self.webdev","score":0,"num_comments":7,"created_utc":1758473617,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nmx3gx","subreddit":"webdev","title":"Can you digest medium-length (5-10 minutes) demo videos that are technical and dry?","selftext":"I wanted to announce a new tool that I made but I missed this weekend's \"Show off Saturday\" because I just couldn't come up with an idea for a video that is both short and informative.\n\nAfter giving it a try today, I ended up with 7 minutes and 30 seconds of video where I just use the app and explain what I'm doing.\n\nDo you think today's web developers can consume this?

It's kinda hard for a free and open-source project to compete with paid, closed-source language learning solutions - so, if you or a friend of yours are into Japanese or coding, please help us out by by giving us a star on Github or, even better, contributing to the project (pwease :,)\n\nWhy am I doing this?

Frontend UIs, async bugs, backend APIs, build chains, observability… and when something breaks, it’s rarely just “a line of code.”\n\nIt’s often a human moment: misread logs, tunnel vision in the debugger, a race condition you couldn’t see coming.\n\nThat’s where I think aviation safety has a ton to teach us. I’ve spent the last year researching real-world aviation accidents (AF447, Helios 522, Tenerife, Qantas 32), and I kept asking: what if software engineering took human factors this seriously?\n\nHere are 3 lessons I think apply directly to the world of JavaScript development:\n\n1) Surface system “modes” clearly - Helios 522, 2005\nA mode switch left in the wrong setting doomed a flight. The crew didn’t notice, and UI design failed them.\n\nJS relevance: Mode confusion is real in software too: are we in staging or prod? Is that button disabled because of a flag or a race? What state is this component actually in?\n\n→ Make modes loud. Add visual markers in dev tools, console banners for envs, visible toggles for feature flags. State needs to shout under stress.\n\n2) Situational awareness is a role, not a side effect -Eastern 401, 1972\nThe crew got fixated on a landing gear light and crashed. Nobody was tracking the big picture.\n\nJS relevance: Ever debugged an issue and realized hours later it wasn’t the real problem? Or missed that a caching layer was involved?\n\n→ Assign someone to keep a full-system view during incidents or deep bugs-especially when working across frontend/backend boundaries. Someone who’s not hands-on-keyboard, but watching what matters.\n\n3) Train for uncertainty, not just happy paths - Qantas 32, 2010\nAn explosion led to cascading alerts. What saved the plane? A crew trained to prioritize and think critically under uncertainty.\n\nJS relevance: Are your devs only trained on smooth dev workflows? Can they diagnose a stale state bug, or cascading API failures in prod?\n\n→ Add “messy drills” to your retros or team demos. Break a small thing (e.g., async race, flaky flag, bad cache) and time how quickly the root cause emerges. Debrief not just what broke-but how you noticed.\n\nIf this sort of thinking resonates, I wrote a book  „Code from the cockpit“ that expands these ideas-from cockpit failures to software recovery strategies. It’s not a checklist book; it’s about how humans, systems, and design interact.\n\nWould love to hear: how do you design for failure in JS-heavy systems?

Key technical features:\n\n* **Gymnasium-compliant interface** \\- drop-in replacement for existing workflows\n* **Stable-Baselines3 integration** \\- works out-of-the-box with PPO, SAC, TD3, etc.\n* **Efficient state management** \\- leverages native emulator save states for fast episode resets\n* **Configurable observation spaces** \\- raw pixels, processed features, or memory states\n* **Action space mapping** \\- handles complex controller inputs to discrete/continuous actions\n\nCurrently supports 4 emulator backends with plans for modern console integration (PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U). The environment abstracts away emulator-specific APIs while preserving access to low-level features when needed.\n\n**Technical implementation highlights:**\n\n* SDL-based architecture for minimal overhead\n* Memory mapping support for game-specific feature extraction\n* Reproducible training through deterministic save state handling\n* Multi-game training capabilities within single environment instance\n\nThis opens up training on thousands of diverse games vs. the typical handful of custom environments.

I will not promote","selftext":"I never raised VC money. Not once. Everything I built was bootstrapped.\n\nIn 2010, I started a consulting firm called Weavora with two partners.\n\nI took sales calls from my car on lunch breaks, then worked nights in our tiny office with ragged curtains and cheap desks.\n\nMy first big challenge was finding clients on Odesk. Back then, even a brand-new profile could win jobs if you wrote thoughtful replies. We found an approach that worked and kept using it. That’s how we landed our first clients.\n\nOutsourcing grew quick. That is probably the fastest way to get started. But the dark side showed up too: endless deadlines, unrealistic demands, and brilliant work thrown in the trash.\n\nWe even worked with a big public company on an important project. Success, right?\n\nBut we didn’t feel like we were doing what we loved. We didn’t want to follow the typical outsourcing path, growing wide, hiring and training people, only to watch them leave. We wanted to stay a small team. My idols at that time were Teehan+Lax\n\nBy 2014, we wanted to try something different. Everyone around us was chasing products, not projects.\n\nWe tested a few ideas. Only one stuck: Everhour.\n\nAt first it was just a side project. By 2016, we shut down consulting and went all-in.\n\nGrowth came naturally through SEO, integrations, and content. Back then, project management tools didn’t have built-in time tracking. We filled that gap.\n\nIt worked. Within a few years Everhour hit $1M ARR with no outside funding. Today it’s multiple times bigger.\n\nBut many advantages slowly faded and we decided to start something new in parallel. We thought that growing another product from 0 to $1M ARR felt more realistic than trying to add the same amount on top of an older, slower-growing one.\n\nWell, it is tough. Starting a new company feels harder and slower than supporting an existing one. It’s tough when expectations don’t match reality.\n\nBootstrapping isn’t sexy. And I can’t say it’s the right path for everyone.\n\nBootstrapping means living on revenue, always keeping a buffer, always staying disciplined. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. And it pulls you in.\n\nOne unwritten rule we set for ourselves and never broke was this: never quit a job or shut down a business until the next one could at least cover basic salaries. That rule gave us resilience.\n\nNow, at almost 40, I’m slowly learning something else, that balance matters more than the race. Sleep debt and stress always come due.\n\nLiving in Cyprus with my family, with the sea and nature around me, I see that building companies is also about building a life.\n\nThe biggest lessons? \n\nFirst - everything has its time and when people talk about their success, they often underestimate the role of luck. A lot of it comes down to being in the right place at the right time.\n\nSecond - don’t just chase opportunity. We kept starting new things to stay alive, curious, and energized. Losing money hurts.

Two main legal pain points are frightening me:  \n\\- GDPR: It seems really complex even for a small app to comply, and as the definition of data is very wide, GDPR practically is relevant to all apps, even small free MVPs.  \n\\- Legal liability: Connected to point one, failing to comply to legal regulations (such as GDPR) leaves one open for legal trouble. Without founding an LLC (or the Dutch equivalent, BV), it is my understanding that I am personally liable for these.\n\nHow do other startups navigate these issues? Do they found an LLC immediately? Do they get insurance? To me the upfront costs of such actions seem very large without even having validated my idea.

Hosted in France.\nMy redesign = Static website: home page, 3 to 4 pages, and form page\n\nThank you for your help 🙏","author":"TryAgain911","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TechSEO/comments/1nnmbr4/complete_website_redesign_domainhosting_transfer/","domain":"self.TechSEO","score":0,"num_comments":0,"created_utc":1758547275,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nn9e9r","subreddit":"TechSEO","title":"Why Is Screaming Frog Showing Archive.org URLs in the Directory Tree Graph?","selftext":"https://preview.redd.it/840fr37rbmqf1.png?width=1514&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e62db20cf9dfba47861a1dadf2189dbf77aad9b2\n\nI was using SF to crawl a site for a new client, and while reviewing the Directory Tree Graph, it returned several URLs like:\n\n[`https://web.archive.org/web/20070617025509im_/http://example.com/images/ALLSMALLPICS/snood1939_small.jpg`](https://web.archive.org/web/20070617025509im_/http://example.com/images/ALLSMALLPICS/snood1939_small.jpg)\n\nI replaced the real domain name with \"example\" to avoid revealing the actual URL.  \nAny ideas why, should I be worried about it?","author":"eagerforcash","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TechSEO/comments/1nn9e9r/why_is_screaming_frog_showing_archiveorg_urls_in/","domain":"self.TechSEO","score":0,"num_comments":4,"created_utc":1758504198,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/p805KDhz5I67IBue9j9Iom-nl2Yy6px4FOWJ1922iuM.jpg"}]},{"subreddit":"business","posts":[{"id":"1nnm3zi","subreddit":"business","title":"Business owner advice?","selftext":"Hey everyone. \n\nI’m 28 years old and have ran businesses since I was 21 but I’m now in a predicament and could use some advice. When I was 21 I started an automotive repair shop that did really well for about 5 years but as some say, partnerships are the only ships that sink - that business went down due to partnership issues. I took some time and ended up starting a marketing company, it’s done well and has been up and running until this day but I decided to get a full time job as I felt I needed some stability with everyone going on in life. I’ve been at this job for 7-8 months now and am making $114,000 a year as a service manager at a dealership with the ability to make much more come January (added commission on pay plan) it’s not a bad job, I’m great at it because I know the industry so well, but I will admit… I’m pretty miserable and feel like I’m wasting my time when I could be starting another business that I’ve wanted for awhile now. \n\nI’m stuck between a rock and a hard place, do I keep working this job and save up enough to buy a running business?\n\nDo I jump ship and start this business?\n\nWhat I want to start will require me to be doing it full time so I can’t start while I work my full time job. \n\nMy wife really wants me to stay with this job because it is good money and I’ll be honest, we haven’t had much stability considering I’ve been doing business since I was 21. We are also looking at getting into another house and being on a salary makes that much easier.\n\nWhat would you do?","author":"MeringueBeneficial47","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1nnm3zi/business_owner_advice/","domain":"self.business","score":1,"num_comments":2,"created_utc":1758546753,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnm2fz","subreddit":"business","title":"Novo Nordisk cuts US obesity education team as layoffs begin, say sources, online posts","selftext":"","author":"DifferentRice2453","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1nnm2fz/novo_nordisk_cuts_us_obesity_education_team_as/","domain":"finance.yahoo.com","score":7,"num_comments":0,"created_utc":1758546645,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnkmqb","subreddit":"business","title":"Pfizer expands obesity drug pipeline with $7.3 billion deal to buy Metsera","selftext":"","author":"Doug24","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1nnkmqb/pfizer_expands_obesity_drug_pipeline_with_73/","domain":"cnbc.com","score":9,"num_comments":0,"created_utc":1758542749,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnj6xw","subreddit":"business","title":"Inside Uniqlo’s Quest for Global Dominance","selftext":"","author":"zsreport","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1nnj6xw/inside_uniqlos_quest_for_global_dominance/","domain":"newyorker.com","score":1,"num_comments":0,"created_utc":1758538222,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nni01z","subreddit":"business","title":"Buffett's Berkshire totally exits its profitable stake in Chinese EV maker BYD bought because of Munger","selftext":"","author":"ControlCAD","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1nni01z/buffetts_berkshire_totally_exits_its_profitable/","domain":"cnbc.com","score":81,"num_comments":4,"created_utc":1758533981,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnhl0t","subreddit":"business","title":"Has anyone here quiet quit their own startup?
