I wanted to find out if that’s just perception or something you can actually measure, so i wired up a harness that runs the same coding/debugging tasks across multiple providers on a schedule and tracks how they drift.\n\nThe hard part wasn’t the charts, it was making the tests fair and repeatable. I ended up using small, unit-testable Python tasks, salting prompts to avoid provider-side caching, running the generated code in a sandbox with time/memory limits, and taking medians over a few trials to dampen noise. Scores are broken down by correctness, code quality signals, efficiency/latency, stability (variance across trials), and a couple of “did it fall on its face?” axes for refusals and brittle fixes. There’s also a historical baseline so a model that suddenly “feels different” shows up as an actual deviation instead of vibes.\n\nIt’s open source and free i’m not selling anything and there are no ads. I honestly built it to sanity-check my own workflow, but it ended up getting way more traffic in the first week than i expected, which tells me a lot of devs are running into the same thing.\n\nIf you want to kick the tires or critique the methodology, I’d love feedback.

Probably the most annoying one is when they upend meetings with the following:\n\n\"Hey guys, I know you are saying that the scope is practically impossible, but I just asked perplexity and it found 2 research papers in 30 seconds, so it is possible and we will move forward with implementing them\"\n\nAnd this would be in the middle of a room of SMEs that just described how difficult to impossible the task is for one of my sub teams.  Taking beyond a 30 second look at these research papers would tell anyone that  they didn't fit our scope or solve the issues we had, and reimplementing them into something that is actually production ready is not going to be as easy as he always seems to think.\n\nI won't go into my job or how it operates, and let me preface this, I don't have the time or support infrastructure in place to make proper production applications, let alone MVPs. Yet as of recently, my core team has been(in addition to our other responsibilities) responsible for taking my sub team's code and hack job productionizing them, with the sub teams being told they essentially need to make MVPs when they don't have the skill, know how, or time just because my boss writes checks with his mouth he can't deliver. I can't explain what we can do to solve it without revealing who we are, but take my word that it's almost impossible.\n\nFor a totally separate client, we had a 3rd party team that I interfaced with make a PoC for a client, and based off the client feedback it was okay at the end of the contract. The client comes back 3 months later complaining that the PoC has too many bugs and things he doesn't like about it to show and shop around. So my boss sits me down and says I need to take it and fix it. I tell him that it was just a PoC and we don't have time to re-write this additional codebase. So guess who has to find time to make this codebase a priority and make it more MVP like :). \n\nI looked at the codebase and it's total AI slop, just piecemealed together to get something working. I told my boss and client that we would need to re-write the entire backend instead of Frankensteining it more to get it working, which will take a few months with all of our other priorities. My boss says \"just use AI, you will get it done in a week or so!\" In front of the client 🙃. He then starts to push onto the client how we could revamp the UI and add all of these UI changes. I explain that due to them using the framework they did, anything beyond simple changes would necessitate a full re-write in a real UI framework. I get told back \"have you heard of Vercel V0, Lovable, etc.... just use one of those and you will get a fully functional UI in minutes, so I'm not worried about scope creep.\" This man has never touched a code base in his life, never made an app/website with code, but yet he is lecturing me on how AI can just do it for us 😁.This is not even taking into account it needs to be in a MVP stage which is beyond what we originally were contracted to do.\n\nWhen I read the article, it triggered me and gave me these flashbacks. I don't know if I'm being too stubborn/close minded, but I think that AI is going to enable more people to think it's just that easy and let them lecture real programmers who knows how hard it is.","author":"aaaafireball","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nnjyoq/would_you_be_annoyed_if_your_boss_used_ai_to/","domain":"futurism.com","score":176,"num_comments":69,"created_utc":1758540724,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnjus2","subreddit":"programming","title":"undertale for xbox360","selftext":"i want to port undertale for the xbox360,i want to publish it too but the person who wants to play has to get the data.win file and put it in the files of the game so no piracy,\n\ni have zero idea on how to port undertale for the 360, i just know they have to mod their console to play and that i can make it in visual studio 2010 with the xbox360 sdk\n\nif anyone is down to do this project hit me up lol.","author":"ConsciousStill9476","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nnjus2/undertale_for_xbox360/","domain":"neog.neocities.org","score":0,"num_comments":0,"created_utc":1758540376,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnhnk0","subreddit":"programming","title":"Building Conway’s Game of Life in Go with raylib-go","selftext":"","author":"der_gopher","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nnhnk0/building_conways_game_of_life_in_go_with_raylibgo/","domain":"packagemain.tech","score":1,"num_comments":0,"created_utc":1758532631,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnh0ng","subreddit":"programming","title":"Clean code = Happy teams!

Even with AI assistance it took a lot of trouble shooting to remain as true as possible to the original language as I could.\n\nBUT DOES IT HAVE...? Yes, there's a list at the bottom.\n\nTerry Davis' story is fascinating and I was contemplating making a documentary about him but I figured that in order to get inside his head I should learn HolyC, and then I should make a port, and now ... I think the CIA is following me (kidding).\n\nThis is not even close to finished but it will compile simple programs as windows executables. Running something like  `schismc.exe hellorld.hc` also works (as well as the ASM output) but there are limitations. I was more concerned with staying true to HolyC than I was with absolute practical functionality.\n\nThere is a lot more work to do, and, to be honest, adding in some sort of graphical component to this scares the living crap out of me - I mean, in Windows? Come on. There really hasn't been any significant testing with command line changes to the running program as of yet either.\n\nWHY: Why would you do something like this? There is no monetary or practical reason for doing something like this. I jsut did.\n\nWHAT'S UP WITH THE NAME? IFKYK - but you know a separation form the HolyC would be a ...\n\nWHY WINDOWS, WHY NOT LINUX?: Okay, I get this one a lot ... simply put, I did most of this work late at night when I am writing scripts (the movie kind, not the python kind, ironic that, huh?) so I was able to easily switch back and forth when my brain need a break from one I would switch to the other. Windows is the OS I write film scripts in so that's what I ported to and what I typically write for anyway. Most of my little apps are solutions for filmmaking problems.\n\nHOW: Originally I began by pulling everything I knew about the language, looking at the code and hand coding what I could. I ran into too many brick walls that I could not get past. I understood the concepts but the Windows (screw PE) part of the equation was too much and assembly was kicking my butt. It wasn't until I picked up full-on vibe coding that I was able to break through some of those walls.\n\nWHAT: I feel like I should be giving my WHY answers here but it's basically a complete basic language and it will compile so I'm going to take my golden star and go home for a few weeks.\n\nHere are some aspects of the project that are specific to HolyC/SchismC and you might find interesting that were implemented:\n\n* Sub-int access (i.u16\\[1\\]) - This is particularly unique to HolyC/SchismC and allows accessing bytes/words within integers\n* Range comparisons (5 &lt; x &lt; 50) - Chained comparison operators\n* No main() function - Code executes on startup without a main entry point\n* String/char literals as statements - Direct execution without function calls\n* Type-prefixed unions - Advanced union declarations with type prefixes\n\nAgain, thought that you all might find this interesting as an experiment, and AGAIN, there is still A LOT of work to do on this but I need a break for a few weeks as I have two movie scripts and a couple of foreign and casting deals to lock up.\n\nPlease feel free to look through it. Complaints will be ignored in the order that they are received.\n\nHere is the HC and ASM output example for \"Hello World\"\n\nhelloworld.hc\n\n`I64 main() {`\n\n`\"Hello, World!\";`\n\n`return 0;`\n\n`}`\n\nAssembly for same:\n\n`; Generated by SchismC - MASM Assembly Output`\n\n`; Target: Windows x64`\n\n`extrn GetStdHandle:PROC`\n\n`extrn WriteConsoleA:PROC`\n\n`extrn ExitProcess:PROC`\n\n`.data`\n\n`str_literal_0 DB \"Hello, World!\", 0`\n\n`.code`\n\n`; Main function`\n\n`main PROC`\n\n`push rbp ; Save caller's frame pointer`\n\n`mov rbp, rsp ; Set up new frame pointer`\n\n`sub rsp, 32h ; Allocate local space`\n\n`; Get stdout handle`\n\n`mov rcx, -11 ; STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE`\n\n`call GetStdHandle`\n\n`mov rdi, rax ; Save handle`\n\n`; Write string to console`\n\n`mov rcx, rdi ; hConsoleOutput`\n\n`lea rdx, [str_literal_0] ; lpBuffer`\n\n`mov r8, 13 ; nNumberOfCharsToWrite`\n\n`mov r9, 0 ; lpNumberOfCharsWritten (NULL)`\n\n`push 0 ; lpReserved (NULL)`\n\n`sub rsp, 32 ; Shadow space`\n\n`call WriteConsoleA`\n\n`add rsp, 40 ; Clean up stack`\n\n`mov rax, 0 ; Integer literal`\n\n`mov rsp, rbp ; Restore stack pointer`\n\n`pop rbp ; Restore caller's frame pointer`\n\n`ret ; Return to caller`\n\n`main ENDP`\n\n`END`","author":"BrandonDirector","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nlibwl/a_windows_port_of_terry_davis_holyc_from_templeos/","domain":"github.com","score":48,"num_comments":19,"created_utc":1758323305,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nlhlpy","subreddit":"programming","title":"\"More Speed &amp; Simplicity: Practical Data-Oriented Design in C++\" - Vittorio Romeo - CppCon 2025 Keynote","selftext":"","author":"SuperV1234","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nlhlpy/more_speed_simplicity_practical_dataoriented/","domain":"youtube.com","score":8,"num_comments":0,"created_utc":1758321398,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nlh5zh","subreddit":"programming","title":"Fail loudly: a plea to stop hiding bugs","selftext":"","author":"alefore","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nlh5zh/fail_loudly_a_plea_to_stop_hiding_bugs/","domain":"alejo.ch","score":156,"num_comments":39,"created_utc":1758320246,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nlergd","subreddit":"programming","title":"Apache Kafka Fundamentals","selftext":"Hi everyone,  \nIn this blog, I tried to explain the different components of Kafka.
