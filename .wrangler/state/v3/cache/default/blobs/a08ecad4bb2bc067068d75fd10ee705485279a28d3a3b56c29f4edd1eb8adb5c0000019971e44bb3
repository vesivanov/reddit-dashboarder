I sourced the product from China and split the cost with him. His dad gave him the money and I used my own money for my half. We began running ads, but he insisted on having some dude his dad knows run the ads, and he ended up doing an insanely tiny budget over 2 weeks and then not running ads again. We still made 2 sales but anytime I’d ask my friend to have the guy run ads again (meta ads account was in his name) , he’d kind of just avoid it. He had much more free time than me and we’d still talk often but any time I’d bring up the business, he’d just avoid it. After months of nagging him and little interest from his side, I created my own Instagram account for the brand and began running ads in the beginning of September. I’ve since sold nearly a quarter of the stock and found a cheaper supplier to restock the more popular variants of the product (new stock still hasn’t arrived). At this point, I’m running ads, handling customers and packing orders entirely on my own, and I haven’t said a word to him about it.

We still made 2 sales but anytime I’d ask my friend to have the guy run ads again (meta ads account was in his name) , he’d kind of just avoid it. He had much more free time than me and we’d still talk often but any time I’d bring up the business, he’d just avoid it.
