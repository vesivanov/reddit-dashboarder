I sourced the product from China and split the cost with him. His dad gave him the money and I used my own money for my half. We began running ads, but he insisted on having some dude his dad knows run the ads, and he ended up doing an insanely tiny budget over 2 weeks and then not running ads again. We still made 2 sales but anytime I’d ask my friend to have the guy run ads again (meta ads account was in his name) , he’d kind of just avoid it. He had much more free time than me and we’d still talk often but any time I’d bring up the business, he’d just avoid it. After months of nagging him and little interest from his side, I created my own Instagram account for the brand and began running ads in the beginning of September.

We still made 2 sales but anytime I’d ask my friend to have the guy run ads again (meta ads account was in his name) , he’d kind of just avoid it. He had much more free time than me and we’d still talk often but any time I’d bring up the business, he’d just avoid it.

This worked for me for years, but people are getting smarter. With the rise of ai, the growth of social media, and the continuing trend of people hating capitalism, collecting emails is getting harder. At the same time, emails have never been more valuable.\n\nMost people would rather shop with a friend instead of a brand. This post is going to show you how to lead with value, become more personable, and create a real relationship with your customers. \n\n**Have you ever collected emails from a page with no products or collections?**\n\nIf you're answer is no, ask yourself why not?\n\nYou can collect 8-10 times more emails by sending people to a landing page that has nothing for sale. If you're just dropshipping bullshit, this entire post is probably meaningless to you. But, if you plan on building your brand and planning on operating it 5 years from now, this marketing angle could be a game-changer for you.\n\nLet's talk about lead generation landing pages. What you can offer in exchange for an email, how to design the landing pages, and how you can get traffic.   \n  \n**What Makes a Lead Gen Page Convert**\n\nKeep it simple.\n\n* Headline that tells them what they’re getting\n* Subheadline that supports the offer\n* One short form (just email or phone)\n* Clean product or lifestyle visual\n* Social proof (logos, reviews, screenshots)\n* Zero distractions (no nav, no links)\n\nExample headlines:\n\n* Join 10,000+ members in our monthly giveaway.\n* Giveaways. Drops. Secret deals. All for email subscribers only.\n* Get the free \\[ebook title\\] + weekly content that actually helps\n* Join the movement. Tools, tips, and updates before anyone else.\n\nThis works whether you're running Reddit traffic, paid traffic, or pushing them from blog content.\n\n# The Offer: What Do People Get for Submitting Their Email?\n\nDon't overcomplicate this. Just offer something they'd actually want right now.\n\nHere are some of the best lead magnets we've seen work across different brands I've built landing pages for:\n\n* **Giveaways** Great for hyping product drops, collecting UGC, or building waitlists. Example: \"Enter to win our summer bundle. Winner announced next week.\"\n* **Niche Ebooks or Guides** This works when your product needs some education or explanation. Example: If you sell skincare, offer a “7-Day Glow-Up Routine” guide.\n* **Early Access or Waitlists** Works well for limited drops, seasonal restocks, or product launches. Example: \"Be the first to shop our winter collection.\"\n* **VIP Clubs or Secret Stores** Create exclusivity. Example: \"Join our VIP list for early access and members-only offers.\"\n* **Quizzes** Personalized and interactive. Example: “Find your perfect match in 30 seconds.”\n\nWhatever you offer, make it feel instant and valuable.  \nNo need to pitch your brand. Just pitch the reason to sign up.\n\n\n\n# Giveaway Leads\n\n**Goal:** Build curiosity and connection. These leads aren't ready to buy.\n\n**What to send:**\n\n* Giveaway confirmation and what to expect\n* Brand story or founder intro\n* UGC and real reviews\n* Behind-the-scenes or product breakdown\n* A blog post or tip-based email\n\nNo hard pitches. Keep it fun and on-brand. These poeple are greta to re-target back into your community. They may never buy, but they will open your emails, comment on your posts ,and maybe even recommend your brand to a friend. \n\n# Ebook or Guide Leads\n\n**Goal:** Educate first, then position the product as the next step.\n\n**What to send:**\n\n* Ebook delivery with a short intro\n* A tip or insight from the content\n* A story or case study\n* Light CTA with zero pressure\n* New blog posts\n* Relevant products\n\nLet the value do the work. Warm them up without pushing too hard.\n\n# Use Blog Content to Nurture\n\nLink relevant blog content in your flows. These posts help build authority and trust.\n\nExamples:\n\n* 3 ways our customers use this every day\n* Why 60% of buyers come back\n* Tips from the team behind \\[brand name\\]\n\n*This is how you turn a cold signup into a fan who actually wants your emails.*\n\n  \nAfter you run these leads through a nurture flow, you begin to send segmented campaigns that send these warm leads to your main website. \n\n# How to Drive Traffic to Your Lead Gen Pages\n\nYou’ve got the offer. You’ve got the flow. Now you just need people to hit the page.\n\nHere are a few ways to drive **qualified traffic** without needing a product page or paid funnel.\n\n# 1. Reddit (low-cost, high-trust)\n\nThis is the best organic traffic source if you’re willing to play the long game.\n\n* Build a subreddit for your niche, not your brand\n* Post value-driven content 4 to 6 times a week\n* Use Reddit DM tools to message users who mention your niche\n* Pin the lead gen page in your sub once it has momentum\n\nNo hard pitch. Just focus on building a space that feels helpful. The traffic and email signups follow.\n\n# 2. Paid Ads (but not how most people use them)\n\nSend cold traffic to your lead gen page. Not to a product page. Not to a catalog.\n\nJust a single-page offer:\n\n* Giveaway signup\n* Waitlist\n* Niche ebook\n* Free tool or checklist\n\nYour only goal is to collect the email. The backend will convert.\n\nBonus: you’re also building retargeting audiences at the same time. You're going to massively increase the volume of emails you collect that can be used in retargeting campaigns. \n\n# 3. Blog Content + SEO\n\nWrite keyword-targeted blog posts that solve specific problems in your niche.\n\nAt the end of each post, offer something free:\n\n* \"Download the checklist\"\n* \"Grab our free guide\"\n* \"Join the community giveaway\"\n\nYou’ll start collecting emails from people who are already searching for answers. These are some of the warmest leads you can get.\n\n# 4. Organic Social Content\n\nTurn short-form content into mini magnets.\n\nInstagram, TikTok, Facebook Groups, X  all of them work if you lead with value.\n\nDrop soft CTAs:\n\n* \"We’re giving away $250 in gear. Join the list.\"\n* \"Comment 'Hike' for a free ebook that includes the best trails in America and elite hiking tips\"\n* \"Want first dibs on our new release? Join the waitlist.\"\n\nKeep it casual. Push the benefit, not the brand. People who sell info products use these funnels all the time. In fact, basically any MMO guru is using an email funnel that leads to a webinar to sell high-ticket products to warm leads. In the past, ecom store owners never had to go this deep. Today, it's a lot different. But if anyone knows how to extract money out of consumers, it's the influencer grifters. Take note of the high ticket funnels, because that's where mid-high ticket ecom marketing is going. \n\n  \n**Final Thoughts**\n\nMost brands are stuck chasing sales from cold traffic. But there's real power behind the backend marketing. \n\nEvery email you collect is more than just a lead. It’s a retargeting audience, a future buyer, a potential referral, and a compounding asset that works even when your ad account gets shut down. Your email list is the only thing you truly own. If you treat it right, it’ll return value every single month.\n\nThe brands that win long-term are the ones that build trust first. They use real nurture flows, strong content, and segmentation to turn cold leads into warm ones who open, engage, and buy.\n\nA great funnel doesn’t just get someone to buy. It builds a relationship, so they keep coming back. If your backend is right, you won’t need to rely on paid ads forever.\n\nWhile building subreddits for niche ecom brands, I figured out quickly that we can't sell directly on Reddit. Once we got the users off reddit, onto a landing page,  and into our email list, we were able to successfully monetize organic traffic. \n\nThe buyers we get from our landing pages are 5x more likely to buy more than once than the buyers that come from cold traffic (ads or influencers). I'll leave it at that.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most brands rely on popouts and abandoned checkouts to grow their email lists.

Here's what went wrong and went well.","selftext":"Little back story, I work a “9-5”, 4 days a week for 10H as a software developer. I work 4 days to have extra time on Fridays, so I can work on my own products and try to gain MRR, so I can eventually stop working for the “9-5” and focus on my own products and clients.\n\nIt all started with me in the shower on the 11th of September. I had an idea, jumped out of the shower. wrote it down in my notepad and forgot about it a for a bit. The next day I went to the gym and thought about the same idea a bit more and texted some people about the idea(I trust their feedback). Those people gave me the confidence to follow this through.

Well I didn’t want to be the twelfth egg in the dozen, so I had to find another angle. That's when it hit me, A Roast! I am tired of always receiving the same kind of feedback when talking to AI. So what if I turn my requested feedback about my website in a roast? In that way I get feedback and a laugh (hopefully).\n\n12th of September \\~10pm I started with the help of my good friend Claude planning the project requirements. What stack I’d be using, what AI tools I would integrate for the roasting of the websites. After a short planning session I started setting up the architecture and went to bed.\n\nBecause I thought this would be a fast project I started with Supabase as my supplier for authentication and database. Stripe as my payment platform because I am familiar with it.\n\nThe first few days went smooth and on a Monday 15 September I thought I was on a roll and I would be able to release this thing on a Thursday 6PM the 140H mark. So I announced it on X. I even started teasing the logo AI generated. I couldn’t have been more wrong.\n\nThe Roasts were working, I was able to roast my own website with different agents, but the roasts were very predictable. The ability to actually listen to roasts was a good thing. I had a lot of laughs during testing. I started working on the AI agent feedback system. That went smooth as well. The next Wednesday (17 Sept.), I was certain I was going to make the release. So I purchased the Domain and added it to my Vercel project. I started preparing for launch. Only doing small tweaks. But then I had the brilliant Idea to make the payment system a little bit more dynamic and scalable for the future by fetching available payment options. This is where my week turned into a nightmare.\n\nOut of nowhere, my payment system wasn’t working anymore. The form wasn’t loading anymore. My Opera browser started seeing my Stripe form as an advertisement. So after debugging for 2-3 hours I decided to test it in Chrome, same issues. Firefox, same issues. I was very tired so I wasn’t really using my brain. I forgot to properly work with version control. Prior to my last commit I already made some changes to the payment logic. And because I started to really rely on Claude I lost control of it.\n\nShit, I didn’t know what to do, I even opened PHPStorm and started digging through my Local history on PHPStorm, to no result, because I don’t really use it for front-end projects. Instead of making a back-up and being really tired and not thinking straight I made the decision to store the current state of the code to a new branch and start over with the improvements I made before messing with the payment system. That went smooth, because I coded it once before so I kinda knew it. After a long stressful annoying night, I went to bed at \\~2AM, satisfied.\n\nThe next morning after a short night of sleep, It was Thursday, the day of the “announced” release. I was very tired. Around 1PM I decided to call it quits for the 9-5 and make up the time next week. I needed to deploy Pagerekt to Vercel. I was making some last minute changes on my personal PC to Pagerekt and was ready to deploy. I needed to restart my local dev server a couple of times. But my personal PC is Windows and for the life of me my local dev server wouldn’t shut down properly.\n\nI decided to grab my Macbook, which I normally don’t use for personal projects and started working from there. First I had to quickly get that up and running. Finally I had all the control I needed over my project. I deployed my project in the hope that I could properly test it before the launch at 6PM. Vercel hit me with the fact that my personal version control account is different than the one from my 9-5. So I had to convert my free account in to a “team” account and had to pay $20/month for the “team” subscription and another $20/month for an extra “seat”. Oh I so didn’t care, I just wanted my project live and working.\n\nFinally the project was deployed and I could start the testing. Then the real problems started to occur. My firebase authentication wasn’t working properly. When I was able to log in, and tried to generate a free roast, the roast timed out. After researching that was an easy fix. But the authentication seemed to be a consistent problem. I focussed heavily on the buggy authentication. It was 6PM, I still wasn’t able to have a stable session.\n\nShit I missed my launch. That’s okay, no reason to give up now. The entire night I spend rebuilding the authentication from Supabase to NextJS Auth. (Best decision I’ve made, this entire project). At 3AM with the authentication being stable, but not being able to create roasts, I went to bed.\n\nThe Friday morning I woke up on the late side of my normal schedule. I grabbed breakfast and went straight to my computer. I fixed the issues that were causing users not being able to create roasts. Then I became lazy and I told Claude to remove my debugging code. He started working on it. After a bit he suggested using a script to remove every debug line. With my still sleepy head I read the script, it looked good, It wasn’t. All of a sudden 1800 errors appeared in my code. Frick, what just happened? Claude also thought it was a good idea to try and solve it. Now there were \\~2500 errors. My blood was cooking, to calm down, I went to the gym. During my gym session I realized I didn’t commit my fixed issues (again). I was furious, the same mistake in less than a week?\n\nBehind my MacBook again after the gym session I tried to fix all \\~2500 errors by hand. After 30 minutes I barely made a dent in the list of errors. There was no way I was going to fix all \\~2500 errors by hand. I had to resort to resetting to my last commit and losing all of my progress again.\n\nNow with a clear goal in mind I started fixing all of the bugs that stopped users from being able to make roasts. Committing every little fix that I did. I made some improvements. I launched it and did some live testing to make sure roasts where being able to be made, payments went through etc. After calling it a day, my partner told me I looked tired. So I went to the bathroom and checked my self in the mirror. Yes I looked very tired, in my mind I just fought a war.\n\nSo after \\~20 hours of being live with my latest product Pagerekt , I had the time to reflect what happened last 160H. My learning are: It’s okay to commit yourself to a deadline, but keep it healthy. This grind wasn’t healthy. I need to use version control better, after 30-60 minutes of work when I take a break, commit your work. While I am tired I tend to make mistakes that I normally don’t make. Take more breaks. It is okay if your deadline you set for yourself isn’t met, the world isn’t going to end. Working with AI API’s is easier than I originally thought. I can do a lot in a really short time. It is fun to challenge myself.\n\nThis was my story about my 160H rodeo, resulting in Pagerekt a landing page/product roasting tool that gives you feedback but also gives you a good laugh about your own landing page and product.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little back story, I work a “9-5”, 4 days a week for 10H as a software developer.

I stayed in the comments.\nEvery single user issue became a feature. Users told me what was broken, what they loved, and what they wished existed.

Since then I have accumulated \\~$2.9m in net worth via assets (excl. my house and excl. actual business value).\n\nMy business is cyclical and niche, and its very \"key man\", so I don't assign any actual value to the business. Over the last 4 years my industry grew, I made a lot of money, it was very fun, but my industry in 2025 is very slow and I am feeling the impact of hordes of new competition, the recession, and a structurally low growth economy. Business is pitifully slow, and no matter how much actual work I put in, it's not changing my ability to grow. The only path to growth is via risks (ie debt) that I'm not comfortable with. I have made it this far taking almost no risk, and I do not want to go back to 0.\n\n2021-2023 were big, then I made \\~$400k net last year, $500k this year, and I figure I'll make $200k next year if things don't improve. The last 2 years I have worked so hard and without a few random large wins, I would have made $150k max each year.\n\nI have seen what running a business with tailwinds does, and there is nothing like it. It's fun, you can be creative and use all of your talents to the max, you're on top of the world and life is just exhilarating. If I could spend the next 10 years in 2023, I would be worth $100m by 2035 no question. Even without the money, I was so happy because I felt I was using all of my abilities I've worked for so long to develop. I need that back in my life again.\n\n**So here's why I'm posting to** r/Entrepreneur **:** if I continue on this path, even with low growth, I can almost certainly hit $10m by the time I hit 40 yo. The knowledge, experience, relationships, and of course my assets, will continue to compound over the next decade and I will have a little empire.\n\nBut every day I am suffering from anxiety and just so much stress that I'm not doing enough. I tasted what thriving feels like and everything else is dull. More than anything I want to feel like I can express my creativity, grow, and profit... for people who aren't in the business world it's hard to understand, but if you've been there you know how it feels. Growth is life. And not being in that state, it tears you apart.\n\nI have a great wife, family, home, friends, hobbies. No problems there. But I can't retire, I have too much energy and I want that feeling back. But I have no idea where to find it, which is just compounding my anxiety.\n\nAnd I have always used this pent up anxiety and dread at not doing enough as fuel, it has always pushed me, but right now it has nowhere to go and is overflowing and burning a hole in me.\n\nI've spent months looking into new businesses that are adjacent to mine, they're all slowing down too because of the recession / growth issues. And unless I buy a business, ie take on debt, they're very key man driven. I've decided that any \"small business\" that is adjacent to mine would be a downgrade from what I do for a variety of reasons, because I can't directly compound, and if it's going to be a slow growth slog, I might as well continue doing what I am doing because it doesn't require nearly as much work at my stage.\n\n**My question:**\n\nFor those of you who have had early career success and encountered a recession / major slowdown, what did you do? How did you pivot, how did you decide how to dedicate time to an existing business that \"works but isn't thriving\" vs new ventures?\n\nIf you have been in my shoes, have had this painful anxiety that was once helpful, did you continue to use it as fuel? Is this how everyone who craves success just feels?","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started a business in 2021 with ~50k to my name.

I need that back in my life again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So here&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m posting to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"/r/Entrepreneur\"&gt;r/Entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; if I continue on this path, even with low growth, I can almost certainly hit $10m by the time I hit 40 yo. The knowledge, experience, relationships, and of course my assets, will continue to compound over the next decade and I will have a little empire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But every day I am suffering from anxiety and just so much stress that I&amp;#39;m not doing enough. I tasted what thriving feels like and everything else is dull. More than anything I want to feel like I can express my creativity, grow, and profit... for people who aren&amp;#39;t in the business world it&amp;#39;s hard to understand, but if you&amp;#39;ve been there you know how it feels. Growth is life. And not being in that state, it tears you apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a great wife, family, home, friends, hobbies. No problems there. But I can&amp;#39;t retire, I have too much energy and I want that feeling back. But I have no idea where to find it, which is just compounding my anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I have always used this pent up anxiety and dread at not doing enough as fuel, it has always pushed me, but right now it has nowhere to go and is overflowing and burning a hole in me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve spent months looking into new businesses that are adjacent to mine, they&amp;#39;re all slowing down too because of the recession / growth issues. And unless I buy a business, ie take on debt, they&amp;#39;re very key man driven. I&amp;#39;ve decided that any &amp;quot;small business&amp;quot; that is adjacent to mine would be a downgrade from what I do for a variety of reasons, because I can&amp;#39;t directly compound, and if it&amp;#39;s going to be a slow growth slog, I might as well continue doing what I am doing because it doesn&amp;#39;t require nearly as much work at my stage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My question:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have had early career success and encountered a recession / major slowdown, what did you do? How did you pivot, how did you decide how to dedicate time to an existing business that &amp;quot;works but isn&amp;#39;t thriving&amp;quot; vs new ventures?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have been in my shoes, have had this painful anxiety that was once helpful, did you continue to use it as fuel? Is this how everyone who craves success just feels?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"Erniethetoad","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nle2b5/29_yo_29m_nw_i_need_help_i_am_dying_of_anxiety/","domain":"self.Entrepreneur","score":0,"num_comments":5,"created_utc":1758312574,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nldxgd","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","title":"If you had an unlimited budget for ads, where would you spend it when launching your business?","selftext":"Hi everyone!

The goal is to show the company cares about something bigger than just profit. Usually involves products that promote sustainability.\n\n**My take:** Hmm, I don’t really fit here, and clearly most companies care about profit, so often they can come off as opportunistic if they’re not genuine, think “greenwashing” or “woke-washing.” That said, some companies are legitimately committed to a cause.\n\n**2.Honest and transparent content marketing:** Focus is to build trust through truth, not hiding flaws or exaggerating benefits. Shows behind-the-scenes production, admits mistakes, often creating authentic connections with the audience, like build-in-public fans (hope the results aren’t fake).  \n**Cons:** TBH it can expose weaknesses, and no one is 100% honest, and being fully transparent can be a competitive disadvantage. It’s really hard to maintain transparency at every level, I think.\n\n**3.Scarcity and urgency marketing**: often used by gurus, dealerships, e-commerce, etc. It’s a psychological tactic to create immediate need, not giving the customer time to fully think. Makes them feel like they might miss a great opportunity, e.g., “Only 3 left, 1 already reserved.”  \n**Cons:** Scarcity can often be fake, which can frustrate customers if they see the same “limited offer” available later.\n\n**4.Controversy / shock marketing:** controversy or provocation often get attention. And last time I tried this, I get the attention, but, in a bad way(shhh). I could literally feel people’s hate through my computer. A brand might release an ad challenging social norms, addressing a taboo, or directly criticizing someone.\n\n**Well known example:** “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” caused a strong reaction, but brand engagement went up (Ahh American Eagle).\n\n**Cons:** Risky strategy, it can offend most of your audience, and nobody wants purely negative attention.\n\n**5.Nostalgia Marketing:** You know evokes past memories to create emotional connections using old music, relaunching classics, referencing movies or shows. **Cons:** Might not attract new customers or younger generations and can make a brand feel outdated or not innovative.\n\nThese are some approaches I’ve seen.

YET I am still telling you - don't do this.\n\nSo for some context:\n\nAbout 36 months ago, I decided to quit my profitable software agency and start a SaaS company. No I didn't bang my head - I - like a lot of people - were convinced by morons on the internet that SaaS would be a great recurring income stream...\n\n\"It's easy\" They said.\n\n\"Just fix your own problems and sell the solution - create recurring income - retire in Bali!\"\n\nThat sounds technically true right? WRONG.\n\nThe reality is this.\n\nYou start with an idea and you start doing some math. All I need is 100 subscribers at $30 a month and then I can just buy some ads. Then I can scale that into a money printing machine.\n\nBut when you launch you quickly realise that the only thing that you've created is a bubbling piece of dog shit that has manifested itself as some Javascript on a screen.\n\nWhy did it go so badly when it was meant to be so simple?\n\nWell firstly, you've skipped some cardinal rules of SaaS - which are:\n\n1. Just because you CAN build it, doesn't mean that you SHOULD.\n\nWhat I mean by that is that the ability to build a fully working software product has never been so easy. For creative programmers, this means that any idea that floats into your head is now possible because of AI however, this is a curse more than it is a blessing.\n\nThe ability to focus on a singular product solution has never been so difficult. I talk to founders constantly and 3 times out of 5 they say the same thing:\n\n\"I have this main project that I am working on AND I'm working on a couple of other things\".\n\nNo. That's never going to work but who can blame you when we live in a world where rapid product creation is encouraged.\n\nOnly focus on one thing, for 12 months. Seriously, otherwise you'll be bouncing around like Bonnie Blue in Ibiza.\n\n2) ALWAYS market before you build\n\nDistribution (particularly in B2C SaaS) is the key. Finding product market fit is the ultimate goal for your startup but this requires both systematic and simultaneous behaviour in regards to marketing and development during the startup stage.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nDuring the entire startup process, your idea is going to go from a concept to a working app but in order for it to turn into a PRODUCT - you need to build something that people will want to hand over money for (in other words, fulfil a need).\n\nThe common idea here is 'selling before you build' but that's not how you should navigate this part of the process.\n\nInstead you require two simultaneous processes:\n\nA) Development  \nB) Marketing\n\nThis process ideally requires two teams working together daily.\n\nTeam number 1 (Marketing) Needs to conduct as much research with IPC's and return daily with feedback and meet with team number 2 (product). Correlations have to be drawn and the product then needs to be iterated. This process needs to be repeated until your company has found PMF.\n\nThis is the EXACT process that every startup goes through. Notion's original idea was a no-code editor. and after two years of the above process - they found PMF with the note-taking solution that we all know of today.\n\nYour original idea is going to mutate into something unrecognisable - don't get sad about it - adapt.\n\n3) The biggest mistake that I see founders is make is that they BUILD TOOLS not SOLUTIONS.\n\nLet's face reality, the bottleneck isn't programming anymore. Any old dribbling teenager with an idea can now spin up a working feature and call it a SaaS. In the sense, software tool creation has become abundant - and GOOD.\n\nI've always said that the idea of micro-saas products becoming popular is bull shit. Customers have always wanted solutions not features.\n\nThis was a turning point for my company and when we realised that we have to become ABSOLUTE experts in the problems that we were solving, we reached PMF in less than 3 months.\n\nWhen I say 'become an expert' - I am not exaggerating. You need to even understand unrelated parts of the problem group that you will likely never build solutions for because if you become an expert - ultimately, you build better products and people gravitate towards you for expert advice as well as solutions.\n\nMy company is an expert in a very niche problem. The results of this are that when we make basic LinkedIn posts - our DM's fill up because we are addressing a very specific customer problem.\n\nSo not only does optimising for solution based SaaS create better products but it also organically drives more customers. It's a win, win.\n\nThe last point is that once you acknowledge that you have to become an expert in a niche problem set - you immediately realise that you're only going to have enough time to build ONE solution. When this clicks, you will progress a lot further because you will realise that you only have enough time to solve one problem well.\n\nYour focus will go through the roof.\n\nAnyway that's my two sense. These principles have helped me and others get from idea, through the startup stage and reach PMF.\n\nThat's it.\n\nOh and if you are one of the lucky ones to reach PMF, you have a beautiful world of endless daily calls and investors shouting at you for overspending on pens to look forwards to.\n\nAhhhh the dream.\n\nTLDR: Found product market fit by becoming an expert in a problem.

Then I can scale that into a money printing machine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you launch you quickly realise that the only thing that you&amp;#39;ve created is a bubbling piece of dog shit that has manifested itself as some Javascript on a screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why did it go so badly when it was meant to be so simple?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well firstly, you&amp;#39;ve skipped some cardinal rules of SaaS - which are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Just because you CAN build it, doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you SHOULD.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I mean by that is that the ability to build a fully working software product has never been so easy. For creative programmers, this means that any idea that floats into your head is now possible because of AI however, this is a curse more than it is a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ability to focus on a singular product solution has never been so difficult. I talk to founders constantly and 3 times out of 5 they say the same thing:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have this main project that I am working on AND I&amp;#39;m working on a couple of other things&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No. That&amp;#39;s never going to work but who can blame you when we live in a world where rapid product creation is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only focus on one thing, for 12 months. Seriously, otherwise you&amp;#39;ll be bouncing around like Bonnie Blue in Ibiza.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) ALWAYS market before you build&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Distribution (particularly in B2C SaaS) is the key. Finding product market fit is the ultimate goal for your startup but this requires both systematic and simultaneous behaviour in regards to marketing and development during the startup stage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the entire startup process, your idea is going to go from a concept to a working app but in order for it to turn into a PRODUCT - you need to build something that people will want to hand over money for (in other words, fulfil a need).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The common idea here is &amp;#39;selling before you build&amp;#39; but that&amp;#39;s not how you should navigate this part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead you require two simultaneous processes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A) Development&lt;br/&gt;\nB) Marketing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This process ideally requires two teams working together daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Team number 1 (Marketing) Needs to conduct as much research with IPC&amp;#39;s and return daily with feedback and meet with team number 2 (product). Correlations have to be drawn and the product then needs to be iterated. This process needs to be repeated until your company has found PMF.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the EXACT process that every startup goes through. Notion&amp;#39;s original idea was a no-code editor. and after two years of the above process - they found PMF with the note-taking solution that we all know of today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your original idea is going to mutate into something unrecognisable - don&amp;#39;t get sad about it - adapt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) The biggest mistake that I see founders is make is that they BUILD TOOLS not SOLUTIONS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s face reality, the bottleneck isn&amp;#39;t programming anymore. Any old dribbling teenager with an idea can now spin up a working feature and call it a SaaS. In the sense, software tool creation has become abundant - and GOOD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always said that the idea of micro-saas products becoming popular is bull shit. Customers have always wanted solutions not features.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a turning point for my company and when we realised that we have to become ABSOLUTE experts in the problems that we were solving, we reached PMF in less than 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I say &amp;#39;become an expert&amp;#39; - I am not exaggerating. You need to even understand unrelated parts of the problem group that you will likely never build solutions for because if you become an expert - ultimately, you build better products and people gravitate towards you for expert advice as well as solutions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My company is an expert in a very niche problem. The results of this are that when we make basic LinkedIn posts - our DM&amp;#39;s fill up because we are addressing a very specific customer problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So not only does optimising for solution based SaaS create better products but it also organically drives more customers. It&amp;#39;s a win, win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last point is that once you acknowledge that you have to become an expert in a niche problem set - you immediately realise that you&amp;#39;re only going to have enough time to build ONE solution. When this clicks, you will progress a lot further because you will realise that you only have enough time to solve one problem well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your focus will go through the roof.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway that&amp;#39;s my two sense. These principles have helped me and others get from idea, through the startup stage and reach PMF.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh and if you are one of the lucky ones to reach PMF, you have a beautiful world of endless daily calls and investors shouting at you for overspending on pens to look forwards to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ahhhh the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Found product market fit by becoming an expert in a problem. Offered other helpful advice and I now hate my investors&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"saas_life","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nk3qvw/saas_will_make_you_miserable_even_if_you_pull_it/","domain":"self.Entrepreneur","score":50,"num_comments":13,"created_utc":1758188138,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nk3lm7","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","title":"Feels good! 23 years old first time Angel backed founder raised 250K no product, no revenue- just a pitch deck.

Recently we had an idea to make a fitness system together and sell to local personal trainers so we know how well it would place itself. Mind you, we have created a project similar to the one we want, but it's 60% of our wanted features. It can be easily be copied and reused, but due to intellectual ownership rules we have, we can't reuse it. We have both agreed that we should make our own thing and then sell it because it would be easier and we would have a contract explaining the usage.\n\nWhen we started to build out the business logic and the system logic it went well, but he wanted us to market the existing project idea (the one mentioned above) and just \"remake the design\". I'm not for that due to regulations and our own agency policies, but he insists. We have left that with \"We'll see as the time goes\".\n\nKnowing that the product is good, I started working on design and started implementing some of the things that are useful (basically, building the project from the ground up). For all that time, he was absent. Not asking what should we do, our do we need something implemented, or anything, just coming home from work or a trip, joining discord, and telling me how his day was and that he is too tired to do anything. Or either he needs to do something (for our product or clients), but he needs to wait for our backend developers to finish something that he asked them. But the most dumb thing is that he just says that he needs something and not tell them how urgent it is, and they just wait for him for clear instructions. Then I need to jump in to give them more insight, but that's the only thing I can do because he is the one responsible for that project and those developers. When the time comes, he needs them present so that he knows what they have done and if needed, give more instructions on what needs to be implemented.\n\n**NOTE**: We have backend engineers that we outsource, but when they finish everything that they do, we tell them to be there so when we ask them to implement something or we have a bug, they jump in.\n\nThe thing that is pissing me of is that he is focused so much on something that we CAN DO and how we are going to be successful if we do that thing, but he is **NOT DOINT ANYTHING** in regards of achieving that goal. He only finds ideas and books meetings.\n\nRecently we had a meeting with 3 personal trainers about the product. The presentation was made BY ME, the script written BY ME and it was presented BY ME. He was present for telling them about the pricing and everything about the discounts but only that part of our 40 minute presentation. Before the pitching, we agreed to make a presentation and a script, but he didn't even once say \"Do you want me to do it?\" or \"Who will do it, you or me?\". I'm not trying to be pathetic and score points, but I think that compromise and agreements between partners is A MUST and that decisions are made together.  \nThe trainers loved the presentation and they wanted to buy the product. But the reality is, **what product?** Yes we have the previous product, but we can not sell it and it doesn't have all the features that we tell the trainers in our presentation.\n\nI'm really frustrated by the lack of interest in his part about doing anything except finding clients and trying to find ways to make us successful, but even with that, we don't really need that many clients and we don't need to give false promises to anyone.\n\nMind you, I have been fired from my last SE job and committed my self fully to the agency and the clients, but he has a full time job and earns a monthly salary, and I don't think he understands that if we want to build something together that really makes money for both of us, that we need to dedicate our time to that one thing.\n\nAny advice and thoughts on my situation will be very much appreciated, because this is driving me insane.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me and my uni friend have started an agency specializing in building SaaS products and websites.

I got myself 255 media interviews before I opened an agency and started recognizing patterns. At this point, I have now gotten 11 clients in industry magazines and 39 clients on TV. \n\nPR is often misunderstood and a lot of agencies are really bad and charging WAY too much. Ill offer 2 contract tips and 5 PR tips that will help you. \n\n**Contracts:**   \n60% down is normal because a PR firm has to do a lot of legwork in the early stages of the campaign. Ask them if they can give a discount for paid in full and you may get a nice 10-15% off. \n\nIts not reasonable to have a performance clause because true PR is fluid and all campaigns are different. Its not an oil change, the variables change every time. That being said, a PR firm that has a three month contract and gets you 2 appearances should either be offering a partial refund or a few free months. ALWAYS CHECK FOR A REFUND CLAUSE. \n\nTrue story: a client hired me and a big agency. I told her not to hire them because they sent their pitch deck on an MS Word Doc and it was very vague. The team demanded that I review their work and give my inputs. Umm excuse me, the client just paid you clowns $25k. Why the fuck am I doing YOUR WORK FOR YOU? I finally convinced the client to fire them halfway after I got them more coverage in half the time. I ended up getting the client on Yahoo Finance, ABC, and several other places plus some speaking gigs and business awards. The lesson here is that a bigger agency doesn't always have the talent. \n\n**PR Strategy:**   \nHave a solid angle - I had a crazy life story. High school and college dropout with severe ADD turned 6 degreed PhD. This equated to 255 interviews and got me on TV, podcasts, newspapers, and magazines. You can't just reach out and expect coverage. Angles can be SME, in person demo, current event perspective, result, achievement, life experience, or event. (That last sentence alone is worth thousands of dollars. Once you understand angles, your chances of coverage soar.) \n\nPair up - Teaming up with a non profit or cause greatly increases your shot at coverage. There are plenty of causes out there, pick a good one and get VISIBLE helping them. \n\nHave a face of the company - Doesnt have to be the CEO, have someone that can articulately go on camera and offer unique perspectives about the event/story. Make sure they dress nice and arent shy. \n\nDatabases - Creating an industry level database is GOLD. I literally have 90 journalists and reporters with contact info in the tech space alone. Any clients that have new software, apps, or are in cyber can quickly be fast tracked to coverage. Its not hard to start one, just research and stack. You want name, company they work for, email and socials. \n\nPress releases work when done right - Its still valuable to have someone do your press releases for a few reasons, the biggest one is searchability.

Newer versions can embed YT videos and can even be industry tailored. \n\nBONUS: 3 actions that are a waste of time and money   \n\\- Those \"97 dollars to get major media coverage\" offers   \n\\- Paying for Forbes/Entrepreneur placement   \n\\- Any PR agency or \"pro\" without a pitch deck or past client results   \n\n\nIf you guys have PR questions, feel free to ask. \n\nTalk soon, there was a Galactus sighting and I need to fuel up the Space Armor and check it out. ","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents of Earth 616, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Award winning PR agency owner here, I&amp;#39;m going to share some insights to the PR game that can help you immensely. I got myself 255 media interviews before I opened an agency and started recognizing patterns. At this point, I have now gotten 11 clients in industry magazines and 39 clients on TV. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PR is often misunderstood and a lot of agencies are really bad and charging WAY too much. Ill offer 2 contract tips and 5 PR tips that will help you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contracts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n60% down is normal because a PR firm has to do a lot of legwork in the early stages of the campaign. Ask them if they can give a discount for paid in full and you may get a nice 10-15% off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its not reasonable to have a performance clause because true PR is fluid and all campaigns are different. Its not an oil change, the variables change every time. That being said, a PR firm that has a three month contract and gets you 2 appearances should either be offering a partial refund or a few free months. ALWAYS CHECK FOR A REFUND CLAUSE. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;True story: a client hired me and a big agency. I told her not to hire them because they sent their pitch deck on an MS Word Doc and it was very vague. The team demanded that I review their work and give my inputs. Umm excuse me, the client just paid you clowns $25k. Why the fuck am I doing YOUR WORK FOR YOU? I finally convinced the client to fire them halfway after I got them more coverage in half the time. I ended up getting the client on Yahoo Finance, ABC, and several other places plus some speaking gigs and business awards.

This product, like nearly every product in the automotive space, is made in China. We had some major complications with inventory during COVID. Ever since then there have been minor steps made to shift to USA production. When Trump got re-elected the decision was officially made despite not being 100% ready for the move. This year from Jan-March I was down to selling C/D tier SKUs because a lot of the main stuff was running out due to not reordering from China. It was all supposed to work out though to pick back up in March/April for the USA made units to hit. Well, as anything would go, there were some issues with the process which have since been ironed out, but it meant that the March/April timeline didn't work out. So from April through the end of July I didn't have shit to sell so I just took it as a little break with the family.

So around 1m, but they say that it will probably take an earn out, seller financing, or some other incentive to get this valuation of 1m, and a sale of around 500-750 is more likely. \n\nLatonas is wanting to do 4x valuation for TTM. So around 1.15m sale\n\n  \nMy personal thoughts, Quiet Light seems more about getting it sold and getting it sold quickly. I would hope it would sell for 550k pretty fast and easy, but I don't really want to go that low on it. I would like to get as close to 1m as possible and I am aware that I need to get sales back up but the guy at Latonas made a great point. I have been in business for 7 years and done a lot to the business. I have carved out a place in my industry that is sort of my own with my exclusive pricing, and with the manufacturing moving to the USA I have solved a big problem for the future of the business. So should I really be punished for bead sales during a necessary transition period? One that many competitors have not made and will be way behind on. I also spent 2024 getting rid of the retail store, getting rid of bigger expenses, and making the business pretty hands off. There are still customer service and sales aspects I have to do on a daily basis but as much of the business is automated as can be. I was working 10-12 hours 6 days a week in 2023 and in 2024 I was working 2-4 hour days 5 days a week. So it has gone from a 60-72 hour a week job, to a 10-20 hour a week business. \n\n  \nI get that the smart thing to do would be to wait and rebound sales and then list it, but I decided to sell the business back in March/April when all this started occurring. I ran my business through COVID and countless other hurtles and I am tired of the stress and mental strain that comes with a business. I have a 2 year old and a 2 month old and I want to just take the next few years off to spend with them until they go off to grade school. I am just tired and I know it is not the ideal time to sell but it is the right time for me to sell for personal reasons. I am not selling it to get rid of the work because I have some billion dollar new venture. I am selling it to fund a few years off, so I need to get as much for it as I can to not only afford to live but also try to mentally and emotionally justify getting rid of my \"baby\" of 7 years. \n\n  \nSo others that have sold through this tariff dip or in similar situations, how did that affect your sale, what did you do, and where are you now? Also open to any and all brokers that can get me a sale for as much as possible without it taking a year to happen? \n\n  \nI am really needing guidance here because signing with any of them means a 3-6 month commitment and I don't want to have to deal with a bunch of tales or double commissions. I want to pick the right broker the first time but I also don't want to settle for a lower valuation just because of a bad year due to some manufacturing changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Been in business for a little over 7 years in the Automotive space.

I have a 2 year old and a 2 month old and I want to just take the next few years off to spend with them until they go off to grade school. I am just tired and I know it is not the ideal time to sell but it is the right time for me to sell for personal reasons. I am not selling it to get rid of the work because I have some billion dollar new venture. I am selling it to fund a few years off, so I need to get as much for it as I can to not only afford to live but also try to mentally and emotionally justify getting rid of my &amp;quot;baby&amp;quot; of 7 years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So others that have sold through this tariff dip or in similar situations, how did that affect your sale, what did you do, and where are you now? Also open to any and all brokers that can get me a sale for as much as possible without it taking a year to happen? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am really needing guidance here because signing with any of them means a 3-6 month commitment and I don&amp;#39;t want to have to deal with a bunch of tales or double commissions. I want to pick the right broker the first time but I also don&amp;#39;t want to settle for a lower valuation just because of a bad year due to some manufacturing changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"mfing-coleslaw","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1njh47w/brokerage_recommendations_quiet_light_website/","domain":"self.Entrepreneur","score":1,"num_comments":1,"created_utc":1758124809,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1njgi14","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","title":"AMA.

One of the most surprisingly lucrative and fastest-growing markets right now? **Custom underwear.**\n\nIt sounds niche, but the wellness and self-care boom has turned what was once a basic necessity into a statement of style, comfort, and personal values. The opportunity for a new brand to break in is huge, but a lot of founders get stuck on the \"how.\"\n\nI wanted to share a practical, step-by-step framework for anyone thinking about starting their own underwear line. No fluff, just the key decisions you need to nail.\n\n**1. Nail Your Niche (Don't Try to Be Everything).** This is where most people fail. Before you even think about design, you have to decide who you are for.\n\n* **Target Audience:** Men? Women? Unisex? Are you targeting a specific body type?\n* **Brand Values:** Are you the eco-friendly, organic cotton brand? The luxury, high-end silk brand? The ultra-comfortable, everyday wear brand?\n* *The Takeaway:* Pick a lane. A strong point of view is your biggest advantage.\n\n**2. Fabric is Everything (Seriously).** This is non-negotiable. Bad fabric will kill your brand, no matter how good the design is.\n\n* **Cotton (Combed/Organic):** The go-to for everyday comfort and a sustainable angle.\n* **Nylon/Spandex:** For a supportive, performance-focused fit (think activewear).\n* **Bamboo:** The sweet spot between luxury and sustainability. It's incredibly soft.\n* *The Takeaway:* Get samples. Wear them. Wash them. Don't cheap out here.\n\n**3. Start Small, Think Big.** You don't need 20 different styles for your launch.\n\n* **Focus on a core collection:** Pick 3-4 essential styles (e.g., briefs, boxers, thongs) and perfect them. A thoughtful first collection sets the tone for your entire brand.\n* **Branding Details Matter:** A custom woven label or a unique packaging experience can instantly make your product feel premium and justify your price point.\n\n**4. Find a Manufacturing Partner, Not Just a Factory.** This is the scariest part for most founders. You need a partner who can handle small initial runs (low MOQs are a lifesaver) and scale with you.\n\n* **Key things to look for:** Flexible MOQs, a wide range of fabric options, and a commitment to quality control.\n* **ALWAYS start with samples.** Never, ever commit to a large production run without having a physical sample in your hands that you are 100% happy with.\n\n**5. Avoid These Common (and Costly) Mistakes:**\n\n* **Ignoring Fabric Quality:** It's the #1 reason for customer complaints and returns.\n* **Forgetting About Fit:** Inconsistent sizing will destroy your reputation. Test on multiple body types.\n\n**Underestimating Shipping:** Plan your logistics and return policy *before* you launch. Bad shipping can ruin a great product experience.
