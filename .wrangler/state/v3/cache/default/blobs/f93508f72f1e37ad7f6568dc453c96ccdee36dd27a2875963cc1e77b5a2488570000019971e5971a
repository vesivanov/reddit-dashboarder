Everything I built was bootstrapped.\n\nIn 2010, I started a consulting firm called Weavora with two partners.\n\nI took sales calls from my car on lunch breaks, then worked nights in our tiny office with ragged curtains and cheap desks.\n\nMy first big challenge was finding clients on Odesk. Back then, even a brand-new profile could win jobs if you wrote thoughtful replies. We found an approach that worked and kept using it. That’s how we landed our first clients.\n\nOutsourcing grew quick. That is probably the fastest way to get started. But the dark side showed up too: endless deadlines, unrealistic demands, and brilliant work thrown in the trash.\n\nWe even worked with a big public company on an important project. Success, right?\n\nBut we didn’t feel like we were doing what we loved. We didn’t want to follow the typical outsourcing path, growing wide, hiring and training people, only to watch them leave. We wanted to stay a small team. My idols at that time were Teehan+Lax\n\nBy 2014, we wanted to try something different. Everyone around us was chasing products, not projects.\n\nWe tested a few ideas. Only one stuck: Everhour.\n\nAt first it was just a side project. By 2016, we shut down consulting and went all-in.\n\nGrowth came naturally through SEO, integrations, and content. Back then, project management tools didn’t have built-in time tracking. We filled that gap.\n\nIt worked. Within a few years Everhour hit $1M ARR with no outside funding. Today it’s multiple times bigger.\n\nBut many advantages slowly faded and we decided to start something new in parallel.

And I can’t say it’s the right path for everyone.\n\nBootstrapping means living on revenue, always keeping a buffer, always staying disciplined. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. And it pulls you in.\n\nOne unwritten rule we set for ourselves and never broke was this: never quit a job or shut down a business until the next one could at least cover basic salaries. That rule gave us resilience.\n\nNow, at almost 40, I’m slowly learning something else, that balance matters more than the race. Sleep debt and stress always come due.\n\nLiving in Cyprus with my family, with the sea and nature around me, I see that building companies is also about building a life.\n\nThe biggest lessons? \n\nFirst - everything has its time and when people talk about their success, they often underestimate the role of luck.
