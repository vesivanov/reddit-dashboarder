Everything I built was bootstrapped.\n\nIn 2010, I started a consulting firm called Weavora with two partners.\n\nI took sales calls from my car on lunch breaks, then worked nights in our tiny office with ragged curtains and cheap desks.\n\nMy first big challenge was finding clients on Odesk. Back then, even a brand-new profile could win jobs if you wrote thoughtful replies. We found an approach that worked and kept using it. That’s how we landed our first clients.\n\nOutsourcing grew quick. That is probably the fastest way to get started. But the dark side showed up too: endless deadlines, unrealistic demands, and brilliant work thrown in the trash.\n\nWe even worked with a big public company on an important project. Success, right?\n\nBut we didn’t feel like we were doing what we loved. We didn’t want to follow the typical outsourcing path, growing wide, hiring and training people, only to watch them leave. We wanted to stay a small team. My idols at that time were Teehan+Lax\n\nBy 2014, we wanted to try something different. Everyone around us was chasing products, not projects.\n\nWe tested a few ideas. Only one stuck: Everhour.\n\nAt first it was just a side project. By 2016, we shut down consulting and went all-in.\n\nGrowth came naturally through SEO, integrations, and content. Back then, project management tools didn’t have built-in time tracking. We filled that gap.\n\nIt worked. Within a few years Everhour hit $1M ARR with no outside funding. Today it’s multiple times bigger.\n\nBut many advantages slowly faded and we decided to start something new in parallel.

And I can’t say it’s the right path for everyone.\n\nBootstrapping means living on revenue, always keeping a buffer, always staying disciplined. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. And it pulls you in.\n\nOne unwritten rule we set for ourselves and never broke was this: never quit a job or shut down a business until the next one could at least cover basic salaries. That rule gave us resilience.\n\nNow, at almost 40, I’m slowly learning something else, that balance matters more than the race. Sleep debt and stress always come due.\n\nLiving in Cyprus with my family, with the sea and nature around me, I see that building companies is also about building a life.\n\nThe biggest lessons? \n\nFirst - everything has its time and when people talk about their success, they often underestimate the role of luck.

I was like, it would be cool to **describe the dream you had last night to ChatGPT and ask it to generate a vivid image for you, and print a t-shirt with the image**. I was excited and believed that people would want to buy these t-shirt.\n\n# Build\n\nI am a pretty solid software engineer; I built websites in my high school, college and grad school; making websites was easy for me. I just got to work. I learnt the new fancy stuff like React, NextJS; I started to write code using Cursor. 90+% of the code was written by AI. I felt empty because I didn’t learnt too much about these frameworks; I understood the high-level concepts and was able to chat with AI using those concepts, but knew little beyond that. Anyways, I built the site, hosted the frontend on Vercel, and the Python backend on Heroku (pure Javascript would be better, if you ask me again). I also pivoted the website to be more general: you enter your description of an image, we print it and ship it to you (using some t-shirt dropshipping service).\n\n# Sell\n\nBuilding was easy; but selling was hard.\n\nI was selling the t-shirts pretty cheap; if I remember correctly, it was $18.99 with free shipping. I was afraid that people wouldn’t buy if it’s too expensive.\n\nI started by buying Google Ads. That was the first time I really understood how Google makes so much money: if someone clicks my link, I pay Google \\~$1. I mean, I knew this is how Google works, but you don’t really understand until you pay Google for real. It was fascinating how you have to increase the quality of your ads and quality of the landing page to reduce the cost of clicks. I was also surprised how little validation that Google did upfront for the website; maybe Google has other ways to detect frauds that I didn’t encounter, because mine was not a fraud.\n\nThe t-shirt printing industry was pretty crowded. I tried to do SEO. But it was pretty hard to move up the rank. There is no easy way to get good backlinks; I guess that’s why Google’s PageRank works. Optimizing home page layout could only do little.\n\nI spent lots of time optimizing Google Ads and tried to guess what customers want: spouse designs and buys a funny t-shirt for each other?, parents buying a cute t-shirt for their kids? Friends buy sarcastic t-shirts? ...\n\n**The happiest day in 2020s**: After trying many techniques for about 2 months, one day, I was working out in the gym and got a Stripe notification. Someone from Ohio bought a t-shirt! I was so happy that I almost bursted into tears. I was so happy that I gave the customer an extra t-shirt for free. The customer ended up buying another t-shirt a few days later. But that was it. The customer was the only one for the lifetime of the site. I had a friend who bought a shirt, but I don’t think that counts.\n\n**Door Hangers**: Google Ads didn’t work well. A lot of visitors clicked the ads, tried it, but didn’t buy. I was frustrated. I came up with the thought that maybe the market for kids is a better fit for the product, and maybe I should target high-income families. Instead of online ads, I wanted to try offline promotions. I spent $100 and printed 500 door hangers with ads targeting parents who may want a cute t-shirt for their kids; I drove to a rich neighborhood and hung the materials to doors, and handed them to whoever I saw. I gave out 100 hangers. The result? Only one visitor came to the website; no purchase.\n\n# Fail\n\nAfter 3 months, I discontinued marketing and eventually turned down the servers.

Image generation API was too expensive. The website allowed the visitor to generate images without login. Although I later put a 20 image limit per visitor, the bill was still too high. There is a dilemma here: you can’t ask people to buy t-shirts before they have a design. Most people tried it but didn’t by. I ended up having to pay a lot.\n2. AI was not good at generating text, at least in 2024. Some users wanted text on their shirt, but the generated text was often gibberish. I later added the feature to allow manually adding text; but still, nobody bought.\n3. It wasn’t too hard for people to use ChatGPT to generate designs and upload to t-shirt printing services. My site made the process simpler by providing a more integrated solution (design and order in one place), and removing background, etc.\n\nHonestly, I still don’t know why 99.9% of people didn’t buy.

The website allowed the visitor to generate images without login. Although I later put a 20 image limit per visitor, the bill was still too high. There is a dilemma here: you can’t ask people to buy t-shirts before they have a design. Most people tried it but didn’t by. I ended up having to pay a lot.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;AI was not good at generating text, at least in 2024. Some users wanted text on their shirt, but the generated text was often gibberish. I later added the feature to allow manually adding text; but still, nobody bought.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It wasn’t too hard for people to use ChatGPT to generate designs and upload to t-shirt printing services. My site made the process simpler by providing a more integrated solution (design and order in one place), and removing background, etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I still don’t know why 99.9% of people didn’t buy.

I was surprised because if your not investing money you dont get to be a 50% partner. He felt strongly otherwise. \n\nI told him I think thats unreasonable.

I know vesting helps, but is there anything else?\n-Should I push harder with the developer I already work with?\n-Do I actually need a team to pitch?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"BuildingAStartup","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1niddia/suggestions_needed_bringing_on_a_partner_i_will/","domain":"self.startups","score":5,"num_comments":8,"created_utc":1758017211,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nicxqa","subreddit":"startups","title":"Pivots &amp; team churn (I will not promote)","selftext":"I'm about two years into a platform/SaaS startup, which is now going through third major pivot.\n\nWe have the same mission and The Why, but the How and the What keeps changing, as we circle around the PMF.\n\nMy question: Is it normal that each major pivot leads to about 60% churn in the team?
