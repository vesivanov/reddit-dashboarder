When I was 21 I started an automotive repair shop that did really well for about 5 years but as some say, partnerships are the only ships that sink - that business went down due to partnership issues. I took some time and ended up starting a marketing company, it’s done well and has been up and running until this day but I decided to get a full time job as I felt I needed some stability with everyone going on in life. I’ve been at this job for 7-8 months now and am making $114,000 a year as a service manager at a dealership with the ability to make much more come January (added commission on pay plan) it’s not a bad job, I’m great at it because I know the industry so well, but I will admit… I’m pretty miserable and feel like I’m wasting my time when I could be starting another business that I’ve wanted for awhile now. \n\nI’m stuck between a rock and a hard place, do I keep working this job and save up enough to buy a running business?\n\nDo I jump ship and start this business?\n\nWhat I want to start will require me to be doing it full time so I can’t start while I work my full time job. \n\nMy wife really wants me to stay with this job because it is good money and I’ll be honest, we haven’t had much stability considering I’ve been doing business since I was 21. We are also looking at getting into another house and being on a salary makes that much easier.\n\nWhat would you do?","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m 28 years old and have ran businesses since I was 21 but I’m now in a predicament and could use some advice.
