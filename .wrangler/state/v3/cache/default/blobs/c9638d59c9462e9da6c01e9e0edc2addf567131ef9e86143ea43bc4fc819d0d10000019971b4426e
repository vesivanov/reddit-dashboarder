Probably the most annoying one is when they upend meetings with the following:\n\n\"Hey guys, I know you are saying that the scope is practically impossible, but I just asked perplexity and it found 2 research papers in 30 seconds, so it is possible and we will move forward with implementing them\"\n\nAnd this would be in the middle of a room of SMEs that just described how difficult to impossible the task is for one of my sub teams.  Taking beyond a 30 second look at these research papers would tell anyone that  they didn't fit our scope or solve the issues we had, and reimplementing them into something that is actually production ready is not going to be as easy as he always seems to think.\n\nI won't go into my job or how it operates, and let me preface this, I don't have the time or support infrastructure in place to make proper production applications, let alone MVPs. Yet as of recently, my core team has been(in addition to our other responsibilities) responsible for taking my sub team's code and hack job productionizing them, with the sub teams being told they essentially need to make MVPs when they don't have the skill, know how, or time just because my boss writes checks with his mouth he can't deliver. I can't explain what we can do to solve it without revealing who we are, but take my word that it's almost impossible.\n\nFor a totally separate client, we had a 3rd party team that I interfaced with make a PoC for a client, and based off the client feedback it was okay at the end of the contract. The client comes back 3 months later complaining that the PoC has too many bugs and things he doesn't like about it to show and shop around. So my boss sits me down and says I need to take it and fix it. I tell him that it was just a PoC and we don't have time to re-write this additional codebase. So guess who has to find time to make this codebase a priority and make it more MVP like :). \n\nI looked at the codebase and it's total AI slop, just piecemealed together to get something working. I told my boss and client that we would need to re-write the entire backend instead of Frankensteining it more to get it working, which will take a few months with all of our other priorities. My boss says \"just use AI, you will get it done in a week or so!\" In front of the client 🙃. He then starts to push onto the client how we could revamp the UI and add all of these UI changes. I explain that due to them using the framework they did, anything beyond simple changes would necessitate a full re-write in a real UI framework. I get told back \"have you heard of Vercel V0, Lovable, etc.... just use one of those and you will get a fully functional UI in minutes, so I'm not worried about scope creep.\" This man has never touched a code base in his life, never made an app/website with code, but yet he is lecturing me on how AI can just do it for us 😁.This is not even taking into account it needs to be in a MVP stage which is beyond what we originally were contracted to do.\n\nWhen I read the article, it triggered me and gave me these flashbacks. I don't know if I'm being too stubborn/close minded, but I think that AI is going to enable more people to think it's just that easy and let them lecture real programmers who knows how hard it is.","author":"aaaafireball","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nnjyoq/would_you_be_annoyed_if_your_boss_used_ai_to/","domain":"futurism.com","score":177,"num_comments":69,"created_utc":1758540724,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nmrkyr","subreddit":"programming","title":"12 Git commands visualized in 3D: a spatial approach to understanding version control","selftext":"","author":"initcommit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nmrkyr/12_git_commands_visualized_in_3d_a_spatial/","domain":"youtube.com","score":69,"num_comments":7,"created_utc":1758460270,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nn0yiu","subreddit":"programming","title":"DXGI debugging: Microsoft put me on a list","selftext":"","author":"waitthatsamoon","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nn0yiu/dxgi_debugging_microsoft_put_me_on_a_list/","domain":"slugcat.systems","score":71,"num_comments":7,"created_utc":1758482407,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nn3azq","subreddit":"programming","title":"Taking a Look at Compression Algorithms","selftext":"","author":"Helpful_Geologist430","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nn3azq/taking_a_look_at_compression_algorithms/","domain":"cefboud.com","score":52,"num_comments":8,"created_utc":1758487880,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nmrvm2","subreddit":"programming","title":"Introduction to HotSpot JVM C2 JIT Compiler, Part 0","selftext":"","author":"SereneCalathea","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nmrvm2/introduction_to_hotspot_jvm_c2_jit_compiler_part_0/","domain":"eme64.github.io","score":15,"num_comments":2,"created_utc":1758461049,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nng8c1","subreddit":"programming","title":"Depth of Field with OpenGL","selftext":"","author":"PeterBrobby","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nng8c1/depth_of_field_with_opengl/","domain":"youtu.be","score":11,"num_comments":2,"created_utc":1758526946,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nmwzmn","subreddit":"programming","title":"Seven stages teams go through with their software tech stack","selftext":"","author":"robbyrussell","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nmwzmn/seven_stages_teams_go_through_with_their_software/","domain":"robbyonrails.com","score":10,"num_comments":1,"created_utc":1758473322,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nndksl","subreddit":"programming","title":"Mill as an Alternative Android Build Tool","selftext":"","author":"lihaoyi","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nndksl/mill_as_an_alternative_android_build_tool/","domain":"mill-build.org","score":4,"num_comments":2,"created_utc":1758517095,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnln86","subreddit":"programming","title":"Netflix's Livestreaming Disaster: The Engineering Challenge of Streaming at Scale","selftext":"","author":"Ani171202","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nnln86/netflixs_livestreaming_disaster_the_engineering/","domain":"anirudhsathiya.com","score":3,"num_comments":0,"created_utc":1758545575,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nmuzlb","subreddit":"programming","title":"Type Stubs and Typeshed in Python: A Developer’s Guide","selftext":"","author":"wyhjsbyb","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nmuzlb/type_stubs_and_typeshed_in_python_a_developers/","domain":"medium.com","score":3,"num_comments":0,"created_utc":1758468632,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnlfua","subreddit":"programming","title":"How to Generate Realistic Fake Logs with Python, Docker, and Kubernetes","selftext":"Logging pipelines are code too — but testing them often gets skipped because of missing data.

I wanted to find out if that’s just perception or something you can actually measure, so i wired up a harness that runs the same coding/debugging tasks across multiple providers on a schedule and tracks how they drift.\n\nThe hard part wasn’t the charts, it was making the tests fair and repeatable. I ended up using small, unit-testable Python tasks, salting prompts to avoid provider-side caching, running the generated code in a sandbox with time/memory limits, and taking medians over a few trials to dampen noise. Scores are broken down by correctness, code quality signals, efficiency/latency, stability (variance across trials), and a couple of “did it fall on its face?” axes for refusals and brittle fixes. There’s also a historical baseline so a model that suddenly “feels different” shows up as an actual deviation instead of vibes.\n\nIt’s open source and free i’m not selling anything and there are no ads. I honestly built it to sanity-check my own workflow, but it ended up getting way more traffic in the first week than i expected, which tells me a lot of devs are running into the same thing.\n\nIf you want to kick the tires or critique the methodology, I’d love feedback.
