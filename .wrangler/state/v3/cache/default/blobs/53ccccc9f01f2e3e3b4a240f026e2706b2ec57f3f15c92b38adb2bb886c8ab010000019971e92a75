But this is complete legal scam because the website's design is horrendous like it was made in 2010 era. To give context, it's a showcase site with only 4 pages. No way we keep paying 80€/month again.\n\nWith that said, we decided to redesign the entire thing from scratch through HTML. For domain, we'll probably migrate to Hostinger and for hosting, GitHub Pages seems to be a good option.\n\nI've heard about how website redesign could affect SEO, how bad things could go? Will our PageRank drop significantly with the domain/host transfer &amp; redesign? I've used tools like PageSpeed Insights and my redesign has a better score, but I wanted to hear your opinions/tips about it.

","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been working on a large-scale site  (200K+ pages) and need to suppress redundant pages on scale to improve crawl budget and free up resources for high-value content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which approach sends the strongest signal to Googlebot?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Meta robots in &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;robots&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;noindex, nofollow&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Googlebot must still fetch and parse the page to see this directive.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Links may still be discovered until the page is fully processed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. HTTP header X-Robots-Tag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK&lt;br/&gt;\nX-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Directive is seen before parsing, saving crawl resources.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prevents indexing and following links more efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Works for HTML + non-HTML (PDFs, images, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions for the group:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For a site with crawl budget challenges, is X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow the stronger and more efficient choice in practice?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Any real-world experiences where switching from &amp;lt;meta&amp;gt; to header-level directives improved crawl efficiency?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Do you recommend mixing strategies (e.g., meta tags for specific page templates, headers for bulk suppression)?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;🙏 Curious to hear how others have handled this at scale. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"nitz___","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TechSEO/comments/1nhpfqq/best_way_to_suppress_redundant_pages_for_crawl/","domain":"self.TechSEO","score":0,"num_comments":22,"created_utc":1757951114,"thumbnail":null}],"partial":false}],"fetched_at":1758552730228}
