This week I was learning the CSS Variables, and I finally got stuck again in the lab, even though I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s correct. Here’s a part of what I wrote in HTML and CSS based on the given instructions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions&lt;/strong&gt;:\nYou should have a div element with the id of legend. It should contain a span element with the text Availability and a div element with the id of legend-gradient.\nYou should give the #legend-gradient element a linear gradient that transitions between all the colors from --color0 to --color5. Each color value should have two color stops (expressed as percentages) to make the transition between colors a hard line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS&lt;/strong&gt;:\nI apologize if this seems silly because I&amp;#39;m a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"SafeWing2595","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nmy7ge/struggling_with_labs/","domain":"reddit.com","score":0,"num_comments":7,"created_utc":1758476143,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/TyRzUHHlDxJHWcSw_YiWSk4b5mIojoh98dhifJpXP3U.jpg"},{"id":"1nmx743","subreddit":"webdev","title":"What could be the reason for some CDN images getting CORS policy errors, but not others?","selftext":"Hello.

I am currently in the fortunate position where I can afford to take some risk, and I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to start a startup for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a technical person. I&amp;#39;m experienced with designing, building, and scaling SaaS platforms and making estimates. However, I have little experience with sales, marketing, and operations. I already have some startup ideas, but I&amp;#39;m open to other ideas as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Statistics show that success is much more likely for co-founders than for solo-founders. Would you recommend that I find a co-founder before settling on an idea?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I would prefer to work with someone who has experience with the business-related side. Would you recommend specifically looking for a business co-founder, rather than a technical co-founder? I know some people who I feel would be good candidates (people who I find intelligent and are able to bring up interesting points), but they are very similar to me in skillset (i.e., technical), and not complementary.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m based in Europe, if that is relevant. Feel free to share your own experiences as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:&lt;br/&gt;\nI&amp;#39;m a technical person looking for someone experienced with the business side of a startup. I&amp;#39;m wondering if that&amp;#39;s the right approach, or if I should just settle on an idea already, work it out, and look for a co-founder in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"Insok","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1nnmiwp/should_i_look_for_a_cofounder_before_settling_on/","domain":"self.startups","score":2,"num_comments":6,"created_utc":1758547770,"thumbnail":null},{"id":"1nnl8r8","subreddit":"startups","title":"10,000 visitors in 4 months… but only $248 revenue (here’s what worked and what didn’t) (i will not promote)","selftext":"I’ve been building a side project since June.
